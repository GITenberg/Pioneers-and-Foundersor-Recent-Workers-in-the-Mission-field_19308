v</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>It has been my endeavour in the ensuing narratives to bring 
together such of the more distinguished Missionaries of the 
English and American nations as might best illustrate the 
character and growth of Mission work in the last two 
centuries.&nbsp; It is impossible to make it a real history of 
the Missions of modern times.&nbsp; If I could, I would have 
followed in the track of Mr. Maclear&rsquo;s admirable volume, 
but the field is too wide, the material at once too numerous and 
too scattered, and the account of the spread of the Gospel in the
distant parts of the earth has yet to be written in volumes far 
exceeding the bulk of those allotted to the &ldquo;Sunday 
Library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two large classes of admirable Missions have been purposely 
avoided,&mdash;namely, those of the Jesuits in Japan, China, and 
North and South America, and those of the Moravians in Greenland,
the United States, and Africa.&nbsp; These are noble works, but 
they are subjects apart, and our narratives deal with men 
exclusively of British blood, with the exception of Schwartz, 
whose toils were so entirely accepted and adopted by the Church 
of England, that he cannot but be reckoned among her 
ambassadors.&nbsp; The object, then, has been to throw together 
such biographies as are most complete, most illustrative, and 
have been found most inciting to stir up 
others&mdash;representative lives, as far as possible&mdash;from 
the time when <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>the destitution of the Red Indians 
first stirred the heart of John Eliot, till the misery of the 
hunted negro brought Charles Mackenzie to the banks of the 
fever-haunted Zambesi.</p>
<p>We think it will be found that, so far from being the talking,
exaggerating, unpractical men that the critical and popular mind 
is apt to suppose, these labourers were in general eminently 
practical and hard-working.&nbsp; They seem to us to range 
themselves into three classes: one, stirred up by the sight of 
the destitution before their eyes, and quietly trying to supply 
those needs; one, inspired by fervid zeal to devote themselves; 
and one, selected by others, taking that selection as a call, and
toiling as a duty, as they would have toiled at any other duty 
set before them.&nbsp; Each and all have their place, and fulfil 
the work.&nbsp; The hindrances and drawbacks are generally not in
the men themselves, nor in the objects of their labour, but first
and foremost in the almost uniform hostility of the colonists 
around, who are used to consider the dark races as subjects for 
servitude, and either despise or resent any attempt at raising 
them in the scale; and next, in the extreme difficulty of 
obtaining means.&nbsp; This it is that has more than anything 
tended to bring Mission work into disrepute.&nbsp; Many people 
have no regular system nor principle of giving&mdash;the 
much-needed supplies can only be charmed out of their pockets by 
sensational accounts, such as the most really hard-working and 
devoted men cannot prevail on themselves to pour forth; and the 
work of collection is left to any of the rank and file who have 
the power of speech, backed by articles where immediate results 
may be dwelt upon to satisfy those who will not sow in faith and 
wait patiently.</p>
<p>And the Societies that do their best to regulate and collect 
the funds raised by those who give, whether on impulse or 
principle, are necessarily managed by home committees, who ought 
to unite the qualities of men of business with an intimate <!-- 
page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
vii</span>knowledge of the needs and governments of numerous 
young churches, among varied peoples, nations, and languages, 
each in an entirely abnormal state; and, moreover, to deal with 
those great men who now and then rise to fulfil great tasks, and 
cannot be judged by common rules.&nbsp; Thus it is that home 
Societies are often to be reckoned among the trials of 
Missionaries.</p>
<p>But we will not dwell on such shortcomings, and will rather 
pass on to what we had designed as the purpose of our present 
introduction; namely, to supplement the information which the 
biographical form of our work has necessitated us to leave 
imperfect, respecting the Missions as well as the men.</p>
<p>Of the Red Indians who first stirred the compassion of John 
Eliot, there is little that is good to tell, or rather there is 
little good to tell of the White man&rsquo;s treatment of 
them.&nbsp; Self-government by the stronger people always falls 
hard on the weaker, and Mission after Mission has been 
extinguished by the enmity of the surrounding Whites and the 
corruption and decay of the Indians.&nbsp; A Moravian Mission has
been actually persecuted.&nbsp; Every here and there some good 
man has arisen and done a good work on those immediately around 
him, and at the present time there are some Indians living upon 
the reserves in the western part of the continent, fairly 
civilized, settled, and Christianized, and only diminishing from 
that law of their physical nature that forbids them to flourish 
without a wilderness in which to roam.</p>
<p>But between the long-settled States of America and those upon 
the shores of the Pacific, lies a territory where the Indian is 
still a wild and savage man, and where hatred and slaughter 
prevail.&nbsp; The Government at Washington would fain act a 
humane part, and set apart reserves of land and supplies, but the
agents through which the transactions are carried on have too 
often proved unfaithful, and palmed off inferior goods <!-- page 
viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
viii</span>on the Indians, or brought up old debts against them; 
and in the meantime mutual injuries work up the settlers and the 
Red men to such a pitch of exasperation, that horrid cruelties 
are perpetrated on the one side, and on the other the wild men 
are shot down as pitilessly as beasts of prey, while the 
travellers and soldiers who live in daily watch and ward against 
the &ldquo;wily savage&rdquo; learn to stigmatize all pity for 
him as a sort of sentimentalism sprung from Cooper&rsquo;s 
novels.</p>
<p>Still, where there is peace, good men make their way, and with
blessed effect.&nbsp; We wish we had room for the records of the 
Bishopric of Minnesota, and the details of the work among the 
Indians; more especially how, when a rising was contemplated to 
massacre the White settlers all along the border, a Christian 
Indian travelled all night to give warning; and how, on another 
occasion, no less than four hundred White women and children were
saved by the interposition of four Christian Indian chiefs.&nbsp;
Perhaps the Church has never made so systematic an effort upon 
the Indians as in Minnesota, and it is to be hoped that there may
be some success.</p>
<p>For the need of system seems to me one of the great morals to 
be deduced from the lives I have here collected.&nbsp; I confess 
that I began them with the unwilling belief that greater works 
had been effected by persons outside the pale of the Church than 
by those within; but as I have gone on, the conviction has grown 
on me that even though the individuals were often great men, 
their works lacked that permanency and grasp that Church work, as
such, has had.</p>
<p>The equality of rank in the ministry of other bodies has 
prevented the original great founders from being invested with 
the power that is really needed in training and disciplining 
inferior and more inexperienced assistants, and produces a want 
of compactness and authority which has disastrous effects in 
movements of emergency.&nbsp; Moreover, the lack of forms causes 
<!-- page ix--><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
ix</span>a deficiency of framework for religion to attach itself 
to, and this is almost fatal to dealing with unintellectual 
minds.</p>
<p>On the whole, the East Indian Missions have prospered 
best.&nbsp; Schwartz was the very type of a founder, with his 
quiet, plodding earnestness, and power of being generally 
valuable; and the impression he made had not had time to die away
before the Episcopate brought authority to deal with the 
difficulties he had left.&nbsp; Martyn was, like Brainerd before 
him, one of the beacons of the cause, and did more by his example
than by actual teaching; and the foundation of the See of 
Calcutta gave stability to the former efforts.&nbsp; Except 
Heber, the Bishops of the Indian See were not remarkable men, but
their history has been put together as a whole for the sake of 
the completion of the subject, as a sample of the difficulties of
the position, and likewise because of the steady progress of the 
labours there recorded.</p>
<p>The Serampore brethren are too notable to be passed over, if 
only for the memorable fact that Carey the cobbler lighted the 
missionary fire throughout England and America at a time when the
embers had become so extinct that our Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel had to borrow workers from Denmark and 
Germany.&nbsp; Indeed, Martyn&rsquo;s zeal was partly lighted by 
Carey, though the early termination of his labours has forced me 
to place his biography before that of the longer-lived Baptist 
friends&mdash;both men of curious and wonderful powers, but whose
history shows the disadvantages of the Society government, and 
whose achievements were the less permanent in consequence.&nbsp; 
The Burmese branch of their work is chiefly noticeable for the 
characters and adventures of Dr. Judson and his three wives, and 
for the interesting display of Buddhism in contact with 
Christianity.&nbsp; According to the statistics in an American 
Missionary Dictionary, the work they founded has not fallen to 
the ground either at Moulmein or Rangoon; while there has also 
sprung <!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>up a hopeful English Church Mission in the same 
quarter.&nbsp; The last thing I saw about it was a mention of the
neatness and dexterity of Burmese girls as needlewomen.</p>
<p>Samuel Marsden may be called the patriarch of Australasian 
Christianity.&nbsp; There is something grand in the bravery of 
the bullet-headed Yorkshireman, now contending with the brutality
of the convicts and their masters, now sleeping among the 
cannibals of New Zealand.&nbsp; His foundations, too, have 
received a superstructure on which we cannot dwell; because, 
happily, the first Bishop of New Zealand is not yet a subject for
biography, and the Melanesian Mission, which has sprung out of 
it, has not yet seen its first generation.</p>
<p>The Polynesian work, of which John Williams was the martyr and
the representative man, has chiefly been carried on by the London
Mission.&nbsp; It has always been a principle with the 
Missionaries of the Anglican Church, whose centre has been first 
New Zealand, then Norfolk Island, never to enter upon any islands
pre-occupied by Christian teachers of any denomination, since 
there is no lack of wholly unoccupied ground, without perplexing 
the spirit of the natives with the spectacle of &ldquo;our 
unhappy divisions;&rdquo; and thus while Melanesia is for the 
most part left to the Church, Polynesia is in the hands of the 
London Mission.&nbsp; Much good has been effected.&nbsp; The 
difficulty is that, for want of supervision, individual 
Missionaries are too much left to themselves, and are in danger 
of becoming too despotic in their islands.&nbsp; At least such is
the impression they sometimes give to officers of the navy.&nbsp;
French aggression has much disturbed them both in Tahiti and in 
the Loyalty Islands, and the introduction of Roman Catholic 
priests into their territory is bitterly resented.&nbsp; On the 
whole, observers tolerably impartial think that the civilization 
which these married teachers bring with them has a happier effect
as an example and stimulus to the natives than the solitary 
ascetic priest,&mdash;a true, self-devoted saint indeed but 
unable to <!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>win the attention of the people in 
their present condition.&nbsp; In India, where asceticism is the 
test of sanctity even among the heathen, the most self-denying 
preacher has the best chance of being respected; but in those 
luxurious islets, poverty and plainness of living, without the 
power of showing the arts of life, get despised.&nbsp; If the 
priests could bring their pomp of worship, and large bands of 
brethren or sisters to reclaim the waste, they might tell upon 
the minds of the people, but at present they go forth few and 
poor, and are little heeded in their isolation.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, too, the antagonism between them and the London 
Mission is desperate.&nbsp; The latter hold the tenets perhaps 
the most widely removed from Catholicism of any Protestant sect, 
and are mostly not educated enough to understand the opposite 
point of view, so that each party would almost as soon see the 
natives unconverted as joining the hostile camp: and precious 
time is wasted in warrings the one against the other.</p>
<p>The most real enemies to Christianity in these seas are, 
however, the lawless traders, the English and American whalers 
and sandal-wood dealers, who bring uncontrolled vice and violence
where they put in for water; while they, on the one hand, corrupt
the natives, on the other they provoke them into reprisals on the
next White men who fall in their way.&nbsp; That the Polynesians 
are good sailors and not bad workmen, has proved another 
misfortune, for they are often kidnapped by unscrupulous captains
to supply the deficiency of labour in some of the Australasian 
settlements.&nbsp; Everywhere it seems to be the unhappy fact 
that Christian men are the most fatal hinderers of God&rsquo;s 
word among the heathen.</p>
<p>Yet most of the more accessible of the isles have a resident 
missionary, and keep up schools and chapels.&nbsp; Their chiefs 
have accepted a Christian code, and the horrid atrocities of 
cannibalism have been entirely given up, though there is still 
much evil prevalent, especially in those which have convenient 
<!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
xii</span>harbours, and are in the pathway of ships.&nbsp; The 
Samoan islanders have a college, managed by an English minister 
and his wife, where teachers are educated not only to much good 
discipline, but to much real refinement, and go forth as 
admirable and self-devoted heralds of the Gospel into other 
isles.&nbsp; They have furnished willing martyrs, and many have 
been far beyond praise.&nbsp; One lack, however, seems to be of 
that definite formularies, a deficiency which leaves the teaching
to depend over much on the individual impressions of the 
teacher.</p>
<p>The chief remnants of cannibalism are to be found in the New 
Hebrides.&nbsp; The leader of the attack on John Williams is 
still alive at Erromango, and the savage defiant nature of this 
people has never been subdued.&nbsp; They belong more to the 
Melanesian than the Polynesian races.&nbsp; The first are more 
like the Negro, the second more like the Malay.&nbsp; The 
Melanesian Missions are in the charge of the Missionary Bishop, 
John Coleridge Patteson, who went out as a priest with the Bishop
of New Zealand in 1855.</p>
<p>The New Zealand story, as I have said, cannot be told in the 
lifetime of the chief actor in it.&nbsp; It is a story of 
startling success, and then of disappointment through colonial 
impracticability.&nbsp; In some points it has been John 
Eliot&rsquo;s experience upon a larger scale; but in this case 
the political quarrel led to the rise of a savage and murderous 
sect among the Maories, a sort of endeavour to combine some 
features of Christianity and even Judaism with the old forgotten 
Paganism, and yet promoting even cannibalism.&nbsp; It is 
memorable, however, that not one Maori who had received Holy 
Orders has ever swerved from the faith, though the 
&ldquo;Hau-Haus&rdquo; have led away many hundreds of 
Christians.&nbsp; Still, a good number remain loyal and faithful,
and hold to the English in the miserable war which is still 
raging, provoked by disputes over the sale of land.</p>
<p>The Melanesian Mission was begun from New Zealand; but whereas
the isles are too hot for English constitutions, they <!-- page 
xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
xiii</span>can only be visited from the sea, and lads are brought
away to be educated for teachers.&nbsp; New Zealand proved too 
cold for these natives of a tropical climate, and the college has
been transplanted to Norfolk Island, where Bishop Patteson has 
fixed his head-quarters.&nbsp; One of his converts from 
Banks&rsquo;s Island has received Holy Orders, and this latter 
group seems in good train to afford a supply of native ministers 
to islands where few Englishmen could take up a permanent 
abode.</p>
<p>The African Missions would afford much detail, but want of 
space has prevented me from mentioning the Rev. George Leacock, 
the West Indian clergyman, who gave up everything when already an
old man to pave the way of the Gospel in the Pongas.&nbsp; And 
the Cape still retains its first Bishop, so that it is only on 
the side of Natal and Zululand, where the workers have passed 
away, that the narrative can be complete.&nbsp; But the African 
Church is extending its stakes in Graham&rsquo;s Town, Orange 
River, Zululand, and Zanzibar; and while the cry from East, West,
and South is still &ldquo;Come over and help us,&rdquo; we cannot
but feel that, in spite of many a failure, many a disappointment,
many a fatal error, still the Gospel trumpet is being blown, and 
not blown in vain, even in the few spots whose history, for the 
sake of their representative men, I have here tried to 
record.&nbsp; Of the Canadian and Columbian Indian Missions, of 
the Sandwich Isles, and of many more, I have here been able to 
say nothing; but I hope that the pictures of these labourers in 
the cause may tend to some understanding, not only of their 
toils, but of their joys, and may show that they were men not 
easily deceived, and thoroughly to be trusted in their own 
reports of their progress.</p>

<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
1</span>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; JOHN ELIOT, THE APOSTLE OF THE RED 
INDIANS.</h2>
<p>Since the great efforts that Britain had made between the 
years 500 and 1000 to bring the knowledge of the truth into the 
still heathen portions of the Continent,&mdash;since the days of 
Columban and Gal, of Boniface and Willibrord,&mdash;there had 
been a cessation of missionary enterprise.&nbsp; The known 
portions of the world were either Christian, or were in the hands
of the Mahommedans; and no doubt much of the adventurous spirit 
which, united with religious enthusiasm, forms the missionary, 
found vent in the Crusades, and training in the military 
orders.&nbsp; The temper of the age, and the hopelessness of 
converting a Mahommedan, made the good men of the third 500 years
use their swords rather than their tongues against the infidel; 
and it was only in the case of men possessing such rare natures 
as those of Francis of Assisi, or Raymond Lull, that the 
possibility of trying to bring over a single Saracen to the faith
was imagined.</p>
<p>It was in the revival from the Paganism with which classical 
tastes had infected the Church, that the spirit of missions again
awoke, stimulated, of course, by the wide discoveries of fresh 
lands that were dawning upon the earth.&nbsp; If from 1000 to 
1500 the progress of the Gospel was confined to the borders <!-- 
page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>of 
the Slavonic nation, the space of time from 1500 onwards has been
one of constant and unwearied effort to raise the standard of the
Cross in the new worlds beyond the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Spain, Portugal, France, as nations, and the great company of 
the Jesuits as one mighty brotherhood, were the foremost in the 
great undertaking; but their doings form a history of their own, 
and our business is with the efforts of our own Church and 
country in the same great cause.</p>
<p>Our work was not taken up so soon as theirs, partly because 
the spirit of colonization did not begin amongst us so early as 
in Spain and Portugal, and partly because the foundations of most
of our colonies were laid by private enterprise, rather than by 
public adventure, and moreover some of the earlier ones in 
unsettled times.</p>
<p>It may be reckoned as one peculiarity of Englishmen, that 
their greatest works are usually not the outcome of enthusiastic 
design, but rather grow upon them by degrees, as they are led in 
paths that they have not known, and merely undertake the duty 
that stands immediately before them, step by step.</p>
<p>The young schoolmaster at Little Baddow, near Chelmsford, who 
decided on following in the track of the Pilgrim Fathers to New 
England, went simply to enjoy liberty of conscience, and to be 
free to minister according to his own views, and never intended 
to become the Apostle of the Red Indians.</p>
<p>Nothing is more remarkable than the recoil from neglected 
truths.&nbsp; When, even in the earliest ages of the Church, the 
Second Commandment was supposed to be a mere enhancing of the 
first, and therefore curtailed and omitted, there was little 
perception that this would lead to popular, though not 
theoretical, idolatry, still less that this law, when again 
brought forward, would be pushed by scrupulous minds to the most 
strange and unexpected consequences, to the over-powering of all 
authority of ancient custom, and to the repudiation of everything
symbolical.</p>
<p>This resolution against acknowledging any obligation to use 
either symbol or ceremony, together with the opposition of the 
hierarchy, led to the rejection of the traditional usages of the 
Church and the previously universal interpretation of Scripture 
in favour of three orders in the ministry.&nbsp; The elders, or 
presbytery, were deemed sufficient; and when, after having for 
many years been carried along, acquiescing, in the stream of the 
<!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
3</span>Reformation, the English Episcopacy tried to make a 
stand, the coercion was regarded as a return to bondage, and the 
more ardent spirits sought a new soil on which to enjoy the 
immunities that they regarded as Christian freedom.</p>
<p>The <i>Mayflower</i> led the way in 1620, and the news of the 
success of the first Pilgrim Fathers impelled many others to 
follow in their track.&nbsp; Among these was John Eliot.&nbsp; He
had been born in 1604 at Nasing in Essex, and had been bred up by
careful parents, full of that strong craving for theological 
studies that characterized the middle classes in the reign of 
James I.</p>
<p>Nothing more is known of his youth except that he received a 
university education, and, like others who have been foremost in 
missionary labours, had a gift for the comparison of languages 
and study of grammar.&nbsp; He studied the Holy Scriptures in the
original tongues with the zeal that was infused into all scholars
by the knowledge that the Authorized Version was in hand, and by 
the stimulus that was afforded by the promise of a copy of the 
first edition to him who should detect and correct an error in 
the type.</p>
<p>The usual fate of a scholar was to be either schoolmaster or 
clergyman, if not both, and young Eliot commenced his career as 
an assistant to Mr. John Hooker, at the Grammar School at Little 
Baddow.&nbsp; He considered this period to have been that in 
which the strongest religious impressions were made upon 
him.&nbsp; John Hooker was a thorough-going Puritan of great 
piety and rigid scruples, and instructed his household diligently
in godliness, both theoretical and practical.&nbsp; Eliot became 
anxious to enter the ministry, but the reaction of Church 
principles, which had set in with James I., was an obstacle in 
his way; and imagining all ceremonial not observed by the foreign
Protestants to be oppressions on Christian liberty, it became the
strongest resolution of the whole party to accept nothing of all 
these rites, and thus ordination became impossible to them, while
the laws were stringent against any preaching or praying publicly
by any unordained person.&nbsp; The instruction of youth was 
likewise only permitted to those who were licensed by the bishop 
of the diocese; and Mr. Hooker, failing to fulfil the required 
tests, was silenced, and, although forty-seven clergy petitioned 
on his behalf, was obliged to flee to Holland.</p>
<p>This decided Eliot, then twenty-seven years of age, on <!-- 
page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
4</span>leaving England, and seeking a freer sphere of action in 
the newly-founded colonies of New England, which held a charter 
from Government.&nbsp; He took leave of his betrothed, of whom we
only know that her Christian name was Anne (gracious), and that 
her nature answered to her name, and sailed on the 3rd of 
November, 1631, in the ship <i>Lyon</i>, with a company of sixty 
persons, among whom were the family of Governor Winthrop.</p>
<p>They landed at Boston, then newly rising into a city over its 
harbour, and there he found his services immediately required to 
conduct the worship in the congregation during the absence of the
pastor, who had gone to England finally to arrange his 
affairs.</p>
<p>On his return, Mr. Eliot was found to be in such favour, that 
the Bostonites strove to retain him as an assistant minister; but
this he refused, knowing that many friends in England wished to 
found a separate settlement of their own; and in less than a year
this arrangement was actually carried out, a steep hill in the 
forest-land was selected, and a staunch band of East Saxons, 
bringing with them the gracious Anne, came forth.&nbsp; John 
Eliot was married, elected pastor, ordained, after Presbyterian 
custom, by the laying on of the hands of the ministers in solemn 
assembly, and then took possession of the abode prepared for him 
and of the building on the top of the hill, where his 
ministrations were to be conducted.</p>
<p>These old fathers of the United States had found a soil, fair 
and well watered; and though less rich than the wondrous alluvial
lands to the west, yet with capacities to yield them plentiful 
provision, when cleared from the vast forest that covered 
it.&nbsp; Nor had they come for the sake of wealth or luxury; the
earnestness of newly-awakened, and in some degree persecuted, 
religion was upon them, and they regarded a sufficiency of food 
and clothing as all that they had a right to seek.&nbsp; Indeed, 
the spirit of ascetiscism was one of their foremost 
characteristics.&nbsp; Eliot was a man who lived in constant 
self-restraint as to both sleep and diet, and, on all occasions 
of special prayer, prefaced them by a rigorous fast&mdash;and he 
seems to have been in a continual atmosphere of devotion.</p>
<p>One of his friends objected (oddly enough as it seems to us) 
to his stooping to pick up a weed in his garden.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Sir, you tell us we must be heavenly-minded.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
5</span>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and this is no 
impediment unto that; for, were I sure to go to heaven to-morrow,
I would do what I do to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, like many a good Christian, his outward life was to him 
full of allegory.&nbsp; Going up the steep hill to his church, he
said, &ldquo;This is very like the way to heaven.&nbsp; 
&rsquo;Tis up hill!&nbsp; The Lord in His grace fetch us 
up;&rdquo; and spying a bush near him, he added, &ldquo;And truly
there are thorns and briars in the way, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had great command of his flock at Roxbury, and was a most 
diligent preacher and catechiser, declaring, in reference to the 
charge to St. Peter, that &ldquo;the care of the lambs is 
one-third part of the charge to the Church of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
An excellent free school was founded at Roxbury, which was held 
in great repute in the time of Cotton Mather, to whom we owe most
of our knowledge of this good man.&nbsp; The biography is put 
together in the peculiar fashion of that day, not 
chronologically, but under heads illustrating his various 
virtues, so that it is not easy to pick out the course of his 
undertakings.&nbsp; Before passing on to that which especially 
distinguished him, we must give an anecdote or two from the 
&ldquo;article&rdquo; denominated &ldquo;His exquisite 
charity.&rdquo;&nbsp; His wife had become exceedingly skilful in 
medicine and in dealing with wounds, no small benefit in a recent
colony scant of doctors, and she gave her aid freely to all who 
stood in need of help.&nbsp; A person who had taken offence at 
something in one of his sermons, and had abused him passionately,
both in speech and in writing, chanced to wound himself severely,
whereupon he at once sent his wife to act as surgeon; and when 
the man, having recovered, came to return thanks and presents, he
would accept nothing, but detained him to a friendly meal, 
&ldquo;and,&rdquo; says Mather, &ldquo;by this carriage he 
mollified and conquered the stomach of his reviler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was also a great enemy to all contention, and would 
ring a loud <i>Courfew Bell</i> wherever he saw the fires of 
animosity.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he heard any ministers complain that
such and such in their flocks were too difficult for them, the 
strain of his answer was still: &ldquo;Brother, compass 
them;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Brother, learn the meaning of those 
three little words, &lsquo;bear, forbear, 
forgive.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once, when at an assembly of ministers a bundle of papers 
containing matters of difference and contention between two 
parties&mdash;who, he thought, should rather unite&mdash;was laid
on the table, Eliot rose up and put the whole upon the fire, 
saying, <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>&ldquo;Brethren, wonder not at that 
which I have done: I did it on my knees this morning before I 
came among you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that &ldquo;exquisite charity&rdquo; seems a little 
one-sided in another anecdote recorded of him, when &ldquo;a 
godly gentleman of Charlestown, one Mr. Foster, with his son, was
taken captive by his Turkish enemies.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6" 
class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; Public prayers were offered for 
his release: but when tidings were received that the 
&ldquo;Bloody Prince&rdquo; who had enslaved him had resolved 
that no captive should be liberated in his own lifetime, and the 
distressed friends concluded, &ldquo;Our hope is lost;&rdquo; Mr.
Eliot, &ldquo;in some of his prayers before a very solemn 
congregation, very broadly begged, &lsquo;Heavenly Father, work 
for the redemption of Thy poor servant Foster, and if the prince 
which detains him will not, as they say, release him so long as 
himself lives, Lord, we pray Thee kill that cruel prince, kill 
him, and glorify Thyself upon him.&rsquo;&nbsp; And now behold 
the answer.&nbsp; The poor captiv&rsquo;d gentleman quickly 
returns to us that had been mourning for him as a lost man, and 
brings us news that the prince, which had hitherto held him, was 
come to an untimely death, by which means he was now set at 
liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to turn their hearts&rdquo; was a form that did not
occur to the earnest suppliant for his friend.&nbsp; But the 
&ldquo;cruel prince&rdquo; was far away out of sight, and there 
was no lack of charity in John Eliot&rsquo;s heart for the 
heathen who came into immediate contact with him.&nbsp; Indeed, 
he was the first to make any real effort for their 
conversion.</p>
<p>The colonists were as yet only a scanty sprinkling in easy 
reach of the coast, and had done little at present to destroy the
hunting-grounds of the Red man who had hitherto held possession 
of the woods and plains.</p>
<p>The country was inhabited by the Pequot Indians, a tall, 
well-proportioned, and active tribe, belonging to the great 
Iroquois nation.&nbsp; They set up their wigwams of bark, around 
which their squaws cultivated the rapidly growing crop of <!-- 
page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
7</span>maize while the men hunted the buffalo and deer, and 
returning with their spoil, required every imaginable service 
from their heavily-oppressed women, while they themselves deemed 
the slightest exertion, except in war and hunting, beneath their 
dignity.&nbsp; Their nature had much that was high and noble; and
in those days had not yet been ruined either by the White 
man&rsquo;s vices or his cruelty.&nbsp; They were neither the 
outcast savages nor the abject inferiors that two hundred years 
have rendered their descendants, but far better realized the 
description in Longfellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hiawatha,&rdquo; of the 
magnificently grave, imperturbably patient savage, the slave of 
his word, and hospitable to the most scrupulous extent.&nbsp; It 
was in mercy and tenderness that the character was the most 
deficient.&nbsp; The whole European instinct of forbearance and 
respect to woman was utterly wanting,&mdash;the squaws were the 
most degraded of slaves; and to the captive the most barbarous 
cruelty was shown.&nbsp; Experience has shown that there is 
something in the nature of the Red Indian which makes him very 
slow of being able to endure civilization, renders wandering 
almost a necessity to his constitution, and generally makes him, 
when under restraint, even under the most favourable conditions, 
dwindle away, lose all his fine natural endowments, and become an
abject and often a vicious being.&nbsp; The misfortune has been 
that, with a few honourable exceptions, it has not been within 
the power of the better and more thoughtful portion of man to 
change the Red Indian&rsquo;s vague belief in his &ldquo;Great 
Spirit&rdquo; to a more systematic and stringent acceptance of 
other eternal verities and their consequent obligations, and at 
the same time leave him free to lead the roving life of the 
patriarchs of old; since, as Scripture itself shows us, it takes 
many generations to train the wandering hunter to a tiller of the
soil, or a dweller in cities; and the shock to the wild man of a 
sudden change is almost always fatal both to mental and bodily 
health.&nbsp; This conclusion, however, has been a matter of slow
and sad experience, often confused by the wretched effects of the
vice, barbarity, and avarice of the settler and seaman, which in 
many cases have counteracted the effects of the missionary, and 
accelerated the extinction of the native.</p>
<p>In John Eliot&rsquo;s time, there was all to hope; and the 
community of Englishmen with whom he lived, though stern, fierce,
intolerant, and at times cruel in their intolerance, did not <!--
page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>embarrass his work nor corrupt the Indians by the grosser
and coarser vices, when, in his biographer&rsquo;s words, 
&ldquo;our Eliot was on such ill terms with the devil as to alarm
him with sounding the silver trumpets of Heaven in his 
territories, and make some noble and zealous endeavours towards 
ousting him of his ancient possessions.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Pilgrim 
Fathers had obtained their land by fair purchase, <i>i.e.</i> if 
purchase could be fair where there was no real mutual 
understanding; and a good deal of interest had been felt in 
England in the religious state of the Red men.&nbsp; The charter 
to the colony had enforced their conversion on the settlers, and 
Dr. Lake, Bishop of Bath and Wells, declared that but for his old
age and infirmities he would have headed a mission to America for
the purpose.&nbsp; Had he done so, perhaps something systematic 
might have been attempted.&nbsp; As it was the new colonists had 
too severe a struggle with their own difficulties to attend to 
their heathen surroundings, even though the seal of their colony 
of Massachusetts represented an Indian with the label in his 
mouth, &ldquo;Come over and help us.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few 
conversions had taken place, but rather owing to the interest in 
the White men&rsquo;s worship taken by individual Indians, than 
to any efforts on the part of the settlers.</p>
<p>Sixteen years, however, passed without overt aggression, 
though already was beginning the sad story that is repeated 
wherever civilized man extends his frontiers.&nbsp; The savage 
finds his hunting-ground broken up, the White man&rsquo;s farm is
ruined by the game or the chase, the luxuries of civilization 
excite the natives&rsquo; desires, mistrust leads to injury, 
retaliation follows, and then war.</p>
<p>In 1634, only two years after Eliot&rsquo;s arrival, two 
gentlemen, with their boat&rsquo;s crew, were killed on the 
Connecticut river, and some of the barbarities took place that we
shall too often have to notice&mdash;attacks by the natives on 
solitary dwellings or lonely travellers, and increasing anger on 
the part of the colonists, until they ceased to regard their 
enemies as fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>However, the Pequots were likewise at war with the Dutch and 
with the Narragansets, or river Indians, and they sent a 
deputation to endeavour to make peace with the English, and 
secure their assistance against these enemies.&nbsp; They were 
appointed to return for their answer in a month&rsquo;s time; and
<!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>after consultation with the clergy, Mr. Dudley and Mr. 
Ludlow, the Governor and Deputy-Governor, decided on making a 
treaty with them, on condition of their delivering up the 
murderers of the Englishmen, and paying down forty beaver and 
thirty otter skins, besides 400 fathoms of wampum, <i>i.e.</i> 
strings of the small whelks and Venus-shells that served as 
current coin, a fathom being worth about five shillings.</p>
<p>It surprises us that Eliot&rsquo;s name first appears in 
connection with the Indians as an objector to this treaty, and in
a sermon too, at Roxbury; not on any grounds of injustice to the 
Indians, but because it had been conducted by the magistrates 
without reference to the people, which was an offence to his 
views of the republican rights to be exercised in the 
colony.&nbsp; So serious was his objection deemed, that a 
deputation was appointed to explain the principles on which 
Government had acted, and thus convince Mr. Eliot, which they did
so effectually that he retracted his censure in his next 
sermon.</p>
<p>Probably this was what first awakened John Eliot&rsquo;s 
interest in the Red-skins; but for the next few years, in spite 
of the treaty, there was a good deal of disturbance on the 
frontier, and some commission of cruelties, until the colonists 
became gradually roused into fury.&nbsp; Some tribes were 
friendly with them; and, uniting with these the Mohicans and 
river Indians, under the conduct of Uncas, the Mohican chief, 
seventy-seven Englishmen made a raid into the Pequot country and 
drove them from it.&nbsp; Then, in 1637, a battle, called 
&ldquo;the Great Swamp Fight,&rdquo; took place between the 
English, Dutch, and friendly Indians on the one hand, and the 
Pequots on the other.&nbsp; It ended in the slaughter of seven 
hundred of the Pequots and thirteen of their Sachems.&nbsp; The 
wife of one of the Sachems was taken, and as she had protected 
two captive English girls she was treated with great 
consideration, and was much admired for her good sense and 
modesty; but the other prisoners were dispersed among the 
settlers to serve as slaves, and a great number of the poor 
creatures were shipped off to the West India Islands to work on 
the sugar plantations.</p>
<p>Those who had escaped the battle were hunted down by the 
Mohicans and Narragansets, who continually brought their scalps 
in to the English towns, and at last they were reduced to sue for
peace when only 200 braves were still living.&nbsp; These, with 
their families, were amalgamated with the Mohicans and <!-- page 
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>Narragansets, and expelled from their former territory, 
on which the English settled.&nbsp; An annual tribute of a length
of wampum, for every male in the tribe, varying according to age 
and rank, was paid to the English, and their supremacy was so 
entirely established that nearly forty years of peace 
succeeded.</p>
<p>Eliot&rsquo;s missionary enterprise, Mather allows, was first 
inspired by the &ldquo;remarkable zeal of the Romish 
missionaries,&rdquo; by whom he probably means the French 
Jesuits, who were working with much effect in the settlements in 
Louisiana, first occupied in the time of Henri IV.&nbsp; Another 
stimulus came from the expressions in the Royal Charter which had
granted licence for the establishment of the colony, namely, 
&ldquo;To win and incite the natives of that country to the 
knowledge and obedience of the only true God and Saviour of 
mankind and the Christian faith, in our Royal intention and the 
Adventurers&rsquo; free profession, is the principal end of the 
Plantation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the devil himself was the Red men&rsquo;s master, and 
came to their assistance when summoned by the incantations of 
their medicine men, was the universal belief of the colonists, in
corroboration of which the following story is 
given:&mdash;&ldquo;The Indians in their wars with us, finding a 
sore inconvenience by our dogs, which would make a sad yelling if
in the night they scented the approaches of them, they sacrificed
a dog to the devil, after which no English dog would bark at an 
Indian for divers months ensuing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the intended contest Mr. Eliot began by preaching and 
making collections from the English settlers, and likewise 
&ldquo;he hires a native to teach him this exotick language, and,
with a laborious care and skill, reduces it into a grammar, which
afterwards he published.&nbsp; There is a letter or two of our 
alphabet which the Indians never had in theirs; though there were
enough of the dog in their temper, there can scarce be found an R
in their language, . . . but, if their alphabet be short, I am 
sure the words composed of it are long enough to tire the 
patience of any scholar in the world; they are <i>Sesquipedalia 
verba</i>, of which their linguo is composed.&nbsp; For instance,
if I were to translate our Loves, it must be nothing shorter than
<i>Noowomantamoonkanunonush</i>.&nbsp; Or to give my reader a 
longer word, <i>Kremmogkodonattootummootiteaonganunnnash</i> is, 
in English, our <i>question</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span>The worthy Mr. Mather adds, with a sort of apology, 
that, having once found that the demons in a possessed young 
woman understood Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, he himself tried them 
with this Indian tongue, and &ldquo;the demons did seem as if 
they understood it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, he thinks the words must
have been growing ever since the confusion of Babel!&nbsp; The 
fact appears to be, that these are what are now called 
agglutinate languages, and, like those of all savage tribes, in a
continual course of alteration&mdash;also often using a long 
periphrastic description to convey an idea or form a name.&nbsp; 
A few familiar instances will occur, such as <i>Niagara</i>, 
&ldquo;thunder of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This formidable language Mr. Eliot&mdash;the anagram of whose 
name, Mather appropriately observes, was 
<i>Toils</i>&mdash;mastered with the assistance of a 
&ldquo;pregnant-witted Indian,&rdquo; who had been a servant in 
an English family.&nbsp; By the help of his natural turn for 
philology, he was able to subdue this instrument to his great and
holy end,&mdash;with what difficulty may be estimated from the 
sentence with which he concluded his grammar: &ldquo;Prayer and 
pains through faith in <span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> 
will do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the year 1646, while Cromwell was gradually 
obtaining a preponderating influence in England, and King Charles
had gone to seek protection in the Scottish army, that John 
Eliot, then in his forty-second year, having thus prepared 
himself, commenced his campaign.</p>
<p>He had had a good deal of conversation with individual Indians
who came about the settlement at Roxbury, and who perceived the 
advantages of some of the English customs.&nbsp; They said they 
believed that in forty years the Red and White men would be all 
one, and were really anxious for this consummation.&nbsp; When 
Eliot declared that the superiority of the White race came from 
their better knowledge of God, and offered to come and instruct 
them, they were full of joy and gratitude; and on the 28th of 
October, 1646, among the glowing autumn woods, a meeting of 
Indians was convoked, to which Mr. Eliot came with three 
companions.&nbsp; They were met by a chief named Waban, or the 
Wind, who had a son at an English school, and was already well 
disposed towards them, and who led them to his wigwam, where the 
principal men of the tribe awaited them.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>&ldquo;All the old men of the 
village,<br />
All the warriors of the nation,<br />
All the Jossakeeds, the prophets,<br />
The magicians, the Wabenos,<br />
And the medicine men, the medas,<br />
Came to bid the strangers welcome.<br />
&lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;O brothers,<br />
That you came so far to see us.&rsquo;<br />
In a circle round the doorway,<br />
With their pipes they sat in silence,<br />
Waiting to behold the strangers,<br />
Waiting to receive their message,<br />
Till the Black Robe chief, the pale face,<br />
From the wigwam came to greet them,<br />
Stammering in his speech a little,<br />
Speaking words yet unfamiliar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Eliot prayed in English, and then preached on the 9th and 
10th verses of the 37th chapter of Ezekiel, where the prophet is 
bid to call the Breath of God from the four winds of heaven to 
give life to the dry bones around.&nbsp; It so happened that the 
Indian word for breath or wind was <i>Waban</i>, and this made a 
great impression, and was afterwards viewed as an omen.</p>
<p>The preacher worked up from the natural religion, of which 
this fine race already had an idea, to the leading Christian 
truths.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then the Black Robe chief, the prophet,<br />
Told his message to the people,<br />
Told the purport of his mission,<br />
Told them of the Virgin Mary,<br />
And her blessed Son, the Saviour:<br />
How in distant lands and ages<br />
He had lived on earth as we do;<br />
How He fasted, prayed, and laboured;<br />
How the Jews, the tribe accursed,<br />
Mocked Him, scourged Him, crucified Him;<br />
How He rose from where they laid Him,<br />
Walked again with His disciples,<br />
And ascended into heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sermon lasted an hour and a quarter, but the Indians are a
dignified and patient people, prone to long discourses 
themselves, and apt to listen to them from others.&nbsp; When he 
finally asked if they had understood, many voices replied that 
they had; and, on his encouraging them to ask questions, many 
intelligent inquiries were made.&nbsp; The whole conference 
lasted <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>three hours, and Mr. Eliot was 
invited to come again, which he did at intervals of about a 
fortnight, and again with good promise.</p>
<p>In one of these meetings they asked, very reasonably, why the 
English called them Indians, a question it could not have been 
easy to answer.&nbsp; The Powaws, or priests, began to make some 
opposition, but Waban was continually going about among the 
people, repeating portions of the instructions he had received, 
and teaching his friends to pray&mdash;for some had at first 
supposed that the English God might not be addressed in the 
native tongue, but only in English.</p>
<p>After some little time, he thought the Indians ripe for being 
taught to live a settled life, and obtained for his 
congregation&mdash;&ldquo;the praying Indians,&rdquo; as they 
were commonly called&mdash;a grant of the site of his first 
instructions.&nbsp; The place was named 
&ldquo;Rejoicing,&rdquo;&mdash;in Indian, a word that soon got 
corrupted into Nonantum; and, under Mr. Eliot&rsquo;s directions,
they divided their grounds with trenches and stone walls, for 
which he gave them tools to the best of his ability.&nbsp; They 
built wigwams of a superior construction, and the women learnt to
spin; there was a continual manufacture of brushes, eel-pots, and
baskets, which were sold in the English towns, together with 
turkeys, fish, venison, and fruits, according to the 
season.&nbsp; At hay and harvest times they would hire themselves
out to work for their English neighbours, but were thought unable
or unwilling to do what sturdy Englishmen regarded as a fair 
day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>A second settlement of praying Indians followed at Neponset, 
around the wigwam of a Sachem named Cutshamakin, a man of rank 
much superior to Waban.&nbsp; He had already been in treaty with 
the English, and had promised to observe the Ten Commandments, 
but had unhappily learnt also from the English that love of drink
which was the bane of the Indian; and while Mr. Eliot was 
formally instructing the family, one of the sons, a boy of 
fifteen, when learning the fifth commandment, persisted in saying
only &ldquo;honour thy mother,&rdquo; and, when admonished, 
declared that his father had given him fire-water, which had 
intoxicated him, and had besides been passionate and violent with
him.&nbsp; The boy had always been a rude, contumacious fellow, 
and at the next lecture day Mr. Eliot turned to the Sachem, and 
lamented over these faults, but added that the first step to 
reforming <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>him would be for his father to set 
the example by a confession of his own sins, which were neither 
few nor light.</p>
<p>The Sachem&rsquo;s pride was subdued.&nbsp; He stood up and 
openly declared his offences, lamenting over them with deep 
sincerity.&nbsp; The boy was so touched that he made humble 
confession in his turn, and entreated forgiveness.&nbsp; His 
parents were so much moved that they wept aloud, and the board on
which Cutshamakin stood was wet with his tears.&nbsp; He was 
softened then, but, poor man, he said: &ldquo;My heart is but 
very little better than it was, and I am afraid it will be as bad
again as it was before.&nbsp; I sometimes wish I might die before
I be so bad again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Cutshamakin! he estimated himself truly.&nbsp; The 
Puritan discipline, which aimed at acting on the conduct rather 
through the conscience and feelings than by means of grace, never
entirely subdued him, and he remained a fitfully fierce, and yet 
repentant, savage to the end of his life.&nbsp; His squaw must 
have been a clever woman; for, being publicly reprimanded by the 
Indian preacher Nabanton, for fetching water on a Sunday, she 
told him after the meeting that he had done more harm by raising 
the discussion than she had done by fetching the water.</p>
<p>Sunday was impressed upon the natives with all the strictness 
peculiar to the British Calvinists in their reaction from the 
ale-feasts, juggleries, and merry-makings of the almost pagan 
fifteenth century.&nbsp; It is never hard to make savage converts
observe a day of rest; they are generally used to keep certain 
seasons already, and, as Mr. Eliot&rsquo;s Indians honestly said,
they do so little work at any time that a weekly abstinence from 
it comes very easily.&nbsp; At Nonantum, indeed, they seem to 
have emulated the Pharisees themselves in their strictness.&nbsp;
Waban got into trouble for having a racoon killed to entertain 
two unexpected guests; and a case was brought up at public 
lecture of a man who, finding his fire nearly gone out, had 
violated the Sabbath by splitting one piece of dry wood with his 
axe.</p>
<p>But the &ldquo;weightier matters of the law&rdquo; were not by
any means forgotten, and there was a continual struggle to cure 
the converts of their new vice of drunkenness, and their old 
habit of despising and maltreating their squaws, who in the 
Christian villages were raised to a state far less degraded; for 
any cruelty <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>or tyranny towards them was made 
matter of public censure and confession in the assembly.</p>
<p>Several more distant journeys were taken by Mr. Eliot, some of
them to the Merrimac River to see a powerful old Sachem of a 
great age, named Passaconaway, who his people believed to be able
to make green leaves grow in winter, trees dance, and water 
burn.</p>
<p>He was so much afraid of the Missionary that he fled away the 
first time he heard he was coming, probably thinking him a great 
sorcerer; but the next time he remained, listened eagerly, 
expressed his intention of praying, and tried to induce Mr. Eliot
to settle in his district.&nbsp; He lived to a great age, and 
left a charge with his children never to contend with the 
English, having convinced himself that the struggle was 
hopeless.&nbsp; Several other Sachems gave a sort of attention: 
and it appeared that the way had been in some degree prepared by 
a French priest, who had been wrecked on Cape Cod, had been 
passed from one tribe to another, and had died among them, but 
not without having left a tradition of teaching which was by some
identified with Eliot&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Of one Sachem, Mather tells a story: &ldquo;While Mr. Eliot 
was preaching of Christ unto the other Indians, a demon appeared 
unto a Prince of the Eastern Indians in a shape that had some 
resemblance of Mr. Eliot or of an English minister, pretending to
be the Englishman&rsquo;s God.&nbsp; The spectre commanded him 
&lsquo;to forbear the drinking of rum and to observe the 
Sabbath-day, and to deal justly with his neighbours;&rsquo; all 
which things had been inculcated in Mr. Eliot&rsquo;s ministry, 
promising therewithal unto him that, if he did so, at his death 
his soul should ascend into a happy place, otherwise descend unto
miseries; but the apparition all the while never said one word 
about Christ, which was the main subject of Mr. Eliot&rsquo;s 
ministry.&nbsp; The Sachem received such an impression from the 
apparition that he dealt justly with all men except in the bloody
tragedies and cruelties he afterwards committed on the English in
our wars.&nbsp; He kept the Sabbath-day like a fast, frequently 
attending in our congregations; he would not meddle with any rum,
though usually his countrymen had rather die than undergo such a 
piece of self-denial.&nbsp; That liquor has merely enchanted 
them.&nbsp; At last, and not long since, this demon appeared 
again unto this pagan, requiring him to kill himself, and 
assuring him <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>that he should revive in a day or 
two, never to die any more.&nbsp; He thereupon divers times 
attempted it, but his friends very carefully prevented it; 
however, at length he found a <i>fair</i> opportunity for this 
<i>foul</i> business, and hanged himself,&mdash;you may be sure 
without his expected resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This story, grotesque as it sounds in the solemn simplicity of
the worthy Puritan, is really only an instance of what takes 
place wherever the light of the Gospel is held up to men capable 
of appreciating its standard of morality, but too proud to bend 
the spirit to accept the doctrine of the Cross.&nbsp; The Sachem 
was but a red-skinned &ldquo;seeker after God,&rdquo; an 
&ldquo;ape of Christianity,&rdquo; like Marcus Aurelius, and like
the many others we shall meet with who loved darkness rather than
light, not so much because their deeds were evil as because their
hearts were proud.</p>
<p>Like all practical men, Eliot found it absolutely necessary to
do what he called &ldquo;carrying on civility with 
religion,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> instructing the converts in such of 
the arts of life as would afford them wholesome industry; but 
want of means was his great difficulty, and in the middle of a 
civil war England was not very likely to supply him.</p>
<p>Still he made his Indians at Nonantum hedge and ditch, plant 
trees, sow cornfields, and saw planks; and some good man in 
England, whose name he never knew, sent him in 1648 ten pounds 
for schools among the natives, half of which he gave to a 
mistress at Cambridge, and half to a master at Dorchester, under 
whom the Indian children made good progress, and he catechized 
them himself most diligently by way of teaching both them and the
parents who looked on.</p>
<p>He had by this time translated the Bible, but it remained in 
manuscript for want of the means of printing it; and his 
favourite scheme of creating an Indian city, with a scriptural 
government, well out of the way of temptation from and 
interference by the English, was also at a standstill, from his 
poverty.</p>
<p>He likewise sustained a great loss in his friend Mr. Shepard, 
who had worked with him with equal devotion and enthusiasm, but 
this loss really led to the fulfilment of his wishes, for Mr. 
Shepard&rsquo;s papers were sent home, and aroused such an 
interest in Calamy and others of the devout ministers in London, 
that the needs of the Indians of New England were brought before 
Parliament, and an ordinance was passed on <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the 27th of 
July, 1649, for the advancement of civilization and Christianity 
among them.&nbsp; Then a corporation was instituted, entitled the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England, of 
which Judge Street was the first president, and Mr. Henry Ashurst
the first treasurer, with powers to receive the collections that 
the ministers in every parish were exhorted to make by authority 
of Parliament, backed up by letters from the two 
Universities.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of opposition; people fancied it a new 
plan of getting money for Government, and were not at all 
interested about the Indians, but money enough was collected to 
purchase lands worth about 500<i>l.</i> or 600<i>l.</i> a year, 
by way of foundation, at a time when the property of Cavaliers 
was going cheap, and the Society was able to undertake the cost 
of printing Eliot&rsquo;s Bible, as well as of building him an 
Indian college, of paying his teachers, and of supplying the 
greatly needed tools and other necessaries for his much-desired 
station.</p>
<p>Still there was a great deal of difficulty and opposition, 
from the English dislike and contempt for the Indians, who were 
judged <i>en masse</i> by the degraded ones who loitered about 
the settlements, begging and drinking; as well as from the Powaws
or medicine men who found their dupes escaping, and tried to 
terrify them by every means by which it was possible to work upon
their superstition.&nbsp; The Sachems, likewise, were finding out
that Christians were less under their tyranny since they had had 
a higher standard, and many opposed Eliot violently, trying to 
drive him from their villages with threats and menacing gestures,
but he calmly answered, &ldquo;I am engaged in the work of God, 
and God is with me.&nbsp; I fear not all the Sachems in the 
country.&nbsp; I shall go on with my work.&nbsp; Touch me if you 
dare;&rdquo; nor did he ever fail to keep the most angry in check
while he was present, though they hated him greatly.&nbsp; Uncas,
the chief of the Mohicans, made a regular complaint to Government
that Eliot and his colleagues prayed by name for the conversion 
of the Mohicans and Narragansets.&nbsp; Even Cutshamakin, when he
heard of the project of an Indian town, broke out against it with
such fury, that all the men in favour of it cowered and slunk 
away from his furious howls and gesticulations.&nbsp; Mr. Eliot 
was left alone to confront him, and looking steadily at him told 
him that, as this was God&rsquo;s work, no fear of him should 
hinder it.&nbsp; The savage quailed <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>before him, 
but afterwards came to him and stated that his objection was that
the praying Indians did not pay him their tribute.&nbsp; Eliot 
kindly answered that this had been complained of before, and that
he had preached a sermon enforcing this duty upon the tribe.</p>
<p>The words were good, said Cutshamakin, but the Indians would 
not obey them.&nbsp; So Mr. Eliot, after consultation with the 
ministers and elders in Boston, invited the Indians who 
understood English to hear a sermon there, and in it the duty of 
rendering to all their due was fully enforced.&nbsp; Afterwards, 
however, the Indians came forward declaring themselves much 
surprised and mortified at being accused of not paying their just
duty to their chief; and they specified the service and gifts: 
each had rendered twenty bushels of corn, six bushels of rye, 
fifteen deer, days spent in hunting, the building of a wigwam, 
reclaiming two acres of land; and the amount when added up amazed
Mr. Eliot.&nbsp; At his next lecture, then, he took for his text 
the rejection by the Saviour of all the kingdoms of the world, 
and personally applied it to Cutshamakin, reproaching him with 
lust of power and worldly ambition, and warning him that Satan 
was tempting him to give up the faith for the sake of recovering 
his arbitrary power.&nbsp; The discourse and the conversation 
that followed again melted the Sachem, and he repented and 
retracted, although he continued an unsafe and unstable man.</p>
<p>At length, in 1651, Mr. Eliot was able to convene his praying 
Indians and with them lay the foundation of a town on the banks 
of Charles River, about eighteen miles to the south-west of 
Boston.&nbsp; The spot, as he believed, had been indicated to him
in answer to prayer, and they named it Natick, or the place of 
hills.&nbsp; The inhabitants of Nonantum removed thither, and the
work was put in hand.&nbsp; A bridge, eighty feet long and nine 
feet wide, had already been laid across the river, entirely by 
Indian workmen, under Mr. Eliot&rsquo;s superintendence; and the 
town was laid out in three streets, two on one side of the river 
and one on the other; the grounds were measured and divided, 
apple-trees planted, and sowing begun.&nbsp; The cellars of some 
of the houses, it is said, remain to the present day.&nbsp; In 
the midst was a circular fort, palisaded with trees, and a large 
house built in the English style, though with only a day or two 
of help from an English carpenter, the lower part of which was 
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>to serve as a place of worship on Sunday, and for a 
school on other days, the upper part as a wardrobe and storehouse
for valuables, and with a room partitioned off, and known as 
&ldquo;the prophet&rsquo;s chamber,&rdquo; for the use of Mr. 
Eliot on his visits to the settlement.&nbsp; Outside were 
canopies, formed by mats stretched on poles, one for Mr. Eliot 
and his attendants, another for the men, and a third for the 
women.&nbsp; These were apparently to shelter a sort of forum, 
and likewise to supplement the school-chapel in warm 
weather.&nbsp; A few English-built houses were raised; but the 
Indians found them expensive and troublesome, and preferred the 
bark wigwams on improved principles.</p>
<p>The spot was secured to the Indians by the Council of 
Government, acting under the Commonwealth at home; but the right 
of local self-government was vested in each township; and Eliot, 
as the guide of his new settlers, could lead them to what he 
believed to be a truly scriptural code, such as he longed to see 
prevail in his native land.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;the blessed day in England, when the Word of God shall be 
their Magna Carta and chief law book, and all lawyers must be 
divines to study the Scripture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His commencement in carrying out this system was to preach 
Jethro&rsquo;s advice to Moses, and thence deduce that the 
Indians should divide themselves into hundreds and into tens, and
elect rulers for each division, each tithing man being 
responsible for the ten under him, each chief of a hundred for 
the ten tithings.&nbsp; This was done on the 6th of August, 1651;
and Eliot declared that it seemed to him as if he beheld the 
scattered bones he had spoken of in his first sermon to the 
Indians, come bone to bone, and a civil political life 
begin.&nbsp; His hundreds and tithings were as much suggested by 
the traditional arrangements of King Alfred as by those of Moses 
in the wilderness; and his next step was, in like manner, partly 
founded on Scripture, partly on English history,&mdash;namely, 
the binding his Indians by a solemn covenant to serve the Lord, 
and ratifying it on a fast-day.&nbsp; His converts had often 
asked him why he held none of the great fast-days with them that 
they saw the English hold, and he had always replied that there 
was not a sufficient occasion, but he regarded this as truly 
important enough.&nbsp; Moreover, a ship containing some 
supplies, sent by the Society in England, had been wrecked, and 
the goods, though saved, were damaged.&nbsp; This he regarded as 
a frown of Providence and a <!-- page 20--><a 
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>fruit of 
sin.&nbsp; Poor Cutshamakin also was in trouble again, having 
been drawn into a great revel, where much spirits had been drunk;
and his warm though unstable temper always made him ready to 
serve as a public example of confession and humiliation.&nbsp; So
when, on the 24th of September, 1651, Mr. Eliot had conducted the
fast-day service, it began with Cutshamakin&rsquo;s confession; 
then three Indians preached and prayed in turn, and Mr. Eliot 
finally preached on Ezra&rsquo;s great fast.&nbsp; There was a 
pause for rest; then the assembly came together again, and before
them Mr. Eliot solemnly recited the terms of the Covenant, by 
which all were to bind themselves to the service of the Lord, and
which included all their principal laws.&nbsp; He asked them 
whether they stood to the Covenant.&nbsp; All the chiefs first 
bound themselves, then the remainder of the people; a collection 
was made for the poor; and so ended that &ldquo;blessed 
day,&rdquo; as the happy apostle of the Indians called it.</p>
<p>When Governor Endicot shortly after visited the place, he was 
greatly struck with the orderliness and civilization he found 
there.&nbsp; &ldquo;I account this one of the best journeys I 
have made for many years,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; Many little 
manufactures were carried on, in particular one of drums, which 
were used for lack of bells in some of the American settlements, 
as a summons to come to church.</p>
<p>There was a native schoolmaster, named Monequassum, who could 
write, read, and spell English correctly, and under whom the 
children were making good progress.&nbsp; Promising lads were 
trained by Mr. Eliot himself, in hopes of making them act as 
missionaries among their brethren.&nbsp; All this time his 
praying Indians were not baptized, nor what he called 
&ldquo;gathered into a Church estate.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seems to 
have been determined to have full proof of their stability before
he so accepted them; for it was from no inclination to Baptist 
views that he so long delayed receiving them.&nbsp; However, on 
the 13th of October, 1652, he convened his brother-ministers to 
hear his Indians make public confession of their faith.&nbsp; 
What the converts said was perfectly satisfactory; but they were 
a long-winded race, accustomed to flowing periods; and as each 
man spoke for himself, and his confession had to be copied down 
in writing, Mr. Eliot himself owns that their &ldquo;enlargement 
of spirit&rdquo; did make &ldquo;the work longsome.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
So longsome it was, that while the schoolmaster was speaking 
every one got restless, <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>and there was a confusion; and the 
ministers, who had a long dark ride through the woods before 
them, went away, and were hard to bring back again, so that he 
had to finish hearing the declarations of faith alone.</p>
<p>Still, he cut off the baptism and organization of a church 
till he had sent all these confessions to be considered by the 
Society in England, printed and published under the title of 
&ldquo;Tears of Repentance,&rdquo; with a dedication to Oliver 
Cromwell.&nbsp; Then came other delays; some from the jealousy 
and distrust of the English, who feared that the Indians were 
going to ally themselves to the Dutch; some from the difficulty 
of getting pastors to join in the tedious task of listening to 
the wordy confessions; and some from the distressing scandal of 
drunkenness breaking out among the Indians, in spite of the 
strict discipline that always punished it.&nbsp; It was not till 
1660 that Mr. Eliot baptized any Indians, and the next day 
admitted them to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, nine years after he had
begun to preach.&nbsp; The numbers we do not know, but there is 
no doubt that he received no adults except well proved and tried 
persons coming up to the Puritan standard of sincerity and 
devotion.</p>
<p>At this time the Society at home was in great danger; for, on 
the Restoration, the charter had become void, and, moreover, the 
principal estate that formed the endowment had been the property 
of a Roman Catholic,&mdash;Colonel Bedingfield,&mdash;who resumed
possession, and refused to refund the purchase money, as 
considering the Society at an end.&nbsp; It would probably have 
been entirely lost, but for the excellent Robert Boyle, so 
notable at once for his science, piety, and beneficence.&nbsp; He
placed the matter in its true light before Lord Clarendon, and 
obtained by his means a fresh charter from Charles II.&nbsp; The 
judgment in the Court of Chancery was given in favour of the 
Society, and Boyle himself likewise endowed it with a third part 
of a grant of the forfeited impropriations in Ireland which he 
had received from the king.&nbsp; But all the time there was a 
great disbelief in the efficacy of the work among the Indians 
both at home and in New England.&nbsp; It was the fashion to call
all the stories of Indian conversions mere devices for getting 
money, and the unhappy, proud hostility that almost always 
actuated the ordinary English colonist in dealing with natives, 
was setting in in full force.&nbsp; However, at Massachusetts, 
the general court appointed an <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>English 
magistrate to hold a court of judicature in conjunction with the 
chiefs of the Christian Indians, and to be in fact a sort of 
special member of government on their behalf.&nbsp; The first so 
appointed was Daniel Gookin, a man of great piety, wisdom, and 
excellence, and a warm friend of Mr. Eliot, with whom he worked 
most heartily, not only in dealing with the Indians of Natick, 
but with all those who came under English jurisdiction, providing
schools, and procuring the observance of the Sunday among 
them.&nbsp; It was also provided that the Christian Indians 
should set apart a tenth of all their produce for the support of 
their teachers&mdash;a practice that Mr. Gookin defended from the
charge of Judaism.&nbsp; It seems as if these good men, who went 
direct to the Old Testament for their politics, must have been 
hard set between their desire of scriptural authority and their 
dread of Judaizing.</p>
<p>It was well for Eliot that he had friends, for in the first 
flush of the tidings of the successes of the Puritans in England,
he had written a set of papers upon Government, entitled the 
&ldquo;Christian Commonwealth,&rdquo; which had been sent to 
England, and there lay dormant for nine or ten years, until in 
the midst of all the excitement on the Restoration, this 
speculative work, the theory of a scholar upon Christian 
democracy, was actually printed and launched upon the world at 
home, whether by an enemy or by an ill-advised friend does not 
appear, and without the author&rsquo;s consent.&nbsp; Complaints 
of this as a seditious book came out to New England, and John 
Eliot was forced to appear before the court, when he owned the 
authorship, but disowned the publication, and retracted whatever 
might have declared the Government of England, by King, Lords, 
and Commons, to be anti-Christian, avowing it to be &ldquo;not 
only a lawful but eminent form of government, and professing 
himself ready to conform to any polity that could be deduced from
Scripture as being of Divine authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; The court 
was satisfied, and suppressed the book, while publishing Mr. 
Eliot&rsquo;s retractation.&nbsp; Some have sneered at his 
conduct on this occasion as an act of moral cowardice; but it 
would be very hard if every man were bound to stand to all the 
political views expressed in an essay never meant for the general
eye, ten years old, and written in the enthusiasm of the 
commencement of an experiment, which to the Presbyterian mind had
proved a grievous disappointment.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>He had a much more important work in hand than the 
defence of old dreams of the reign of the saints&mdash;for the 
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England had just
finished printing his translation of the New Testament, <i>Wusku 
Wuttestermentum</i> as it was called, and in two years more the 
Old Testament was finished.&nbsp; A copy was presented to Charles
II., to the Chancellor Clarendon, and to the two Universities in 
England, as well as to Harvard College.&nbsp; It was in the 
Mohican dialect, which was sufficiently like that of the 
neighbouring tribes to serve for them, and had all the 
correctness that the scholarship and philology of the time could 
furnish.&nbsp; There is a story that Eliot wrote the whole with a
single pen.&nbsp; It went through a good many editions, but is 
now very rare, and with Eliot&rsquo;s Catechism, and translations
of Baxter&rsquo;s chief works, and a metrical version of the 
Psalms, remains the only vestige of the language of the 
Mohicans.</p>
<p>There were now several Indian congregations, one in especial 
at the island called Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, under the charge of
an Indian pastor, John Hiacoomes, who is said to have been the 
first red-skinned convert, and who had made proof of much true 
Christian courage.&nbsp; Once in the act of prayer he received a 
severe blow from a Sachem, and would have been killed if some 
English had not been present; but all his answer was, &ldquo;I 
have two hands.&nbsp; I had one hand for injuries, and the other 
for God.&nbsp; While I did receive wrong with the one, the other 
laid the greater hold on God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When some of the Powaws, or medicine men, were boasting that 
they could, if they would, destroy all the praying Indians at 
once, Hiacoomes made reply: &ldquo;Let all the Powaws in the 
island come together, I&rsquo;ll venture myself in the midst 
among them all.&nbsp; Let them use all their witchcrafts.&nbsp; 
With the help of God, I&rsquo;ll tread upon them all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By which defiance he wonderfully &ldquo;heartened&rdquo; his 
flock, who, Christians as they were, had still been beset by the 
dread of the magic arts, in which, as we have seen, even their 
White teachers did not wholly disbelieve.</p>
<p>Such a man as this was well worthy of promotion, and Mr. Eliot
hoped to educate his more promising scholars, so as to supply a 
succession of learned and trained native pastors.&nbsp; Two young
men, named Joel and Caleb, were sent to Harvard College, 
Cambridge, where they both were gaining distinguished <!-- page 
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>success, and were about to take their degree, when Joel,
who had gone home on a visit, was wrecked on the Island of 
Nantucket, and, with the rest of the ship&rsquo;s company, was 
either drowned or murdered by the Indians.&nbsp; The name of 
Caleb, Chee-shah-teau-muck, Indus, is still to be seen in the 
registers of those who took their degree, and there are two Latin
and Greek elegies remaining, which he composed on the death of an
eminent minister, bearing his signature, with the addition, 
Senior Sophister.&nbsp; How curiously do the Hebrew, Greek, and 
Latin proclaim themselves the universal languages, thus blending 
with the uncouth Mohican word!&nbsp; Caleb&rsquo;s constitution 
proved unable to endure College discipline and learning, and he 
died of decline soon after taking his degree.&nbsp; Consumption 
was very frequent among the Indians, as it so often is among 
savages suddenly brought to habits of civilization, and it seems 
to have mown down especially the more intellectual of the 
Indians; Monequassum, the first schoolmaster at Natick, among 
them.&nbsp; An Indian College, which had been established at 
Cambridge, failed from the deaths of some scholars and the 
discouragement of others, and had to be turned into a printing 
house, and the energetic and indefatigable Eliot did the best he 
could by giving courses of lectures in logic and theology to 
candidates for the ministry at Natick, and even printed an 
&ldquo;Indian logick primer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a wonderful 
feat, considering the loose unwieldy words of the language.</p>
<p>From 1660 to 1675 were Eliot&rsquo;s years of chief 
success.&nbsp; His own vigour was unabated, and he had Major 
Gookin&rsquo;s hearty co-operation.&nbsp; There had been time for
a race of his own pupils to grow up; and there had not been time 
for the first love of his converts to wax cool.&nbsp; There had 
been a long interval of average peace and goodwill between 
English and natives, and there seemed good reason to suppose that
Christianity and civilization would keep them friends, if not 
fuse them together.&nbsp; There were eleven hundred Christian 
Indians, according to Eliot and Gookin&rsquo;s computation, with 
six regularly constituted &ldquo;churches&rdquo; after the 
fashion of Natick, and fourteen towns, of which seven were called
old and seven new, where praying Indians lived, for the most 
part, in a well-conducted, peaceable manner, though now and then 
disorderly conduct would take place, chiefly from 
drunkenness.&nbsp; Several Sachems had likewise been converted, 
in especial Wanalanset, the eldest son <!-- page 25--><a 
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>of the famous
old chief Passaconnaway.&nbsp; After four years of hesitation 
whether he should, as he said, quit his old canoe and embark in a
new one, he came to the conclusion that the old canoe was 
floating down the stream of destruction, and manfully embraced 
the faith, although at the cost of losing many of his tribe, who 
deserted him on his profession of Christianity.</p>
<p>But there is always a period of check and disappointment in 
every great and holy work.&nbsp; The tide of evil may be driven 
into ebb for a time, but it always rallies and flows back upon 
the servant of God, and usually when the prime of his strength is
past, and he is less able to withstand.&nbsp; Most good and great
men have closed their eyes upon apparent failure and 
disappointment in what is especially their own task, and, like 
the first great Leader and Lawgiver, have had to cry, &ldquo;Show
Thy servants Thy work, and their children Thy glory.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Often the next generation does see the success, and gather the 
fruits; but the strong, wise, scholarly, statesman-like Apostle 
of the Indians was destined to see his work swept away like snow 
before the rage and fury of man, and to leave behind him little 
save a great witness and example.&nbsp; At least he had the 
comfort of knowing that the evil did not arise among his own 
children in the faith, but came from causes entirely external, 
and as much to be preferred as persecution is better than 
corruption.</p>
<p>The Sachem nearest to Plymouth had been at the first arrival 
of the Pilgrim Fathers, Massasoiet, chief of the Wampanongs, who 
had kept the peace out of fear.&nbsp; His son Alexander had 
followed his example, but it was current among the English that 
he had died of &ldquo;choler,&rdquo; on being detected in a plot 
against them, and his successor, Philip, was a man of more than 
common pride, fierceness, cunning, and ability.&nbsp; These were 
only names given them by the English; none of them were 
Christians.&nbsp; Mr. Eliot had made some attempts upon Philip, 
but had been treated with scorn.&nbsp; The Sachem, twisting a 
button upon the minister&rsquo;s coat, told him he cared not 
<i>that</i> for his Gospel; but Major Gookin had some hopes of 
having touched his heart.</p>
<p>However, there were indications that he was endeavouring to 
unite all the surrounding tribes in an alliance against the 
colony.&nbsp; A murder of an Englishman had taken place, and the 
Government at Plymouth required all natives to surrender the 
fire-arms they had obtained from the English.&nbsp; Even Philip 
<!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
26</span>consented to deliver them up until the English should 
see no further cause for detaining them.&nbsp; Upon this, in June
1671, Eliot wrote a remarkable letter to Mr. Prince, the Governor
of Plymouth, requiring him not to detain the arms, especially of 
Philip.&nbsp; &ldquo;My reasons are,&rdquo; he says, 
&ldquo;first, lest we render ourselves more afraid of them and 
their guns than indeed we are or have cause to be.&nbsp; Alas! it
is not the gun, but the man; nor, indeed, is it the man, but our 
sin that we have cause to be afraid of.&nbsp; Secondly, your so 
doing will open an effectual door to the entertainment of the 
Gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably Mr. Eliot was right, and the 
keeping the arms only irritated the high-spirited chief, who said
to the messenger of the Governor of Massachusetts, &ldquo;Your 
governor is but a subject.&nbsp; I will not treat but with my 
brother, King Charles of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For four years enmity smouldered on.&nbsp; The rights of the 
dispute will never be known.&nbsp; The settlers laid all upon 
Philip&rsquo;s machinations, except those who lived near his 
wigwams and knew him best; and they said that so far from 
entering into a conspiracy, he always deplored the war, but was 
forced on by the rage and fury of the young braves, over whom the
Sachems had no real power, and who wanted to signalize their 
valour, and could not fail to have their pride insulted by the 
demeanour of the ordinary English.&nbsp; One instance of 
brutality on the river Saco is said to have been the immediate 
cause of the war in that district.&nbsp; Some English sailors, 
seeing a canoe with an Indian woman and her infant, and having 
heard that a papoose could swim like a duck, actually upset the 
canoe to make the experiment.&nbsp; The poor baby sank, and the 
mother dived and brought it up alive, but it died so soon after, 
that the loss was laid to the charge of the cruel men by the 
father, who was a Sachem named Squando, of considerable dignity 
and influence, a great medicine man.</p>
<p>On Philip&rsquo;s border to the southward, a plantation called
Swawny was attacked and burnt by the Indians in the June of 
1675.&nbsp; He is said to have shed tears (impassible Indian as 
he was) at the tidings, foreseeing the utter ruin of his people; 
and, twenty days after, Squando&rsquo;s influence led to another 
attack 200 miles off, and this was viewed as a sign of complicity
with Philip.</p>
<p>There was deadly terror among the English.&nbsp; The Indians 
swarmed down at night on lonely villages and farmhouses, <!-- 
page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>slew, scalped, burnt, and now and then carried off 
prisoners to be tortured to death, and children to tell by and by
strange tales of life in the wigwams.&nbsp; The militia were 
called out, but left their houses unprotected.&nbsp; At 
Newich-wannock, the farmhouse of a man named Tozer was attacked 
by the Indians when only tenanted by fifteen women and 
children.&nbsp; A girl of eighteen, who was the first to see the 
approach, bravely shut the door and set her back against it; thus
giving time for the others to escape by another door to a better 
secured building.&nbsp; The Indians chopped the door to pieces 
with their hatchets, knocked the girl down, left her for dead, 
and hurried on in pursuit of the others, but only came up with 
two poor little children, who had not been able to get over the 
fence.&nbsp; The rest were saved, and the brave girl recovered 
from her wounds; but other attacks ended far more fatally for the
sufferers, and the rage and alarm of the New Englanders were 
great.&nbsp; A few of the recently taught and unbaptized Indians 
from what were called the &ldquo;new praying towns&rdquo; had 
joined their countrymen; and though the great body of the 
converts were true and faithful, the English confounded them all 
in one common hatred to the Red-skin.&nbsp; The magistrates and 
Government were not infected by this blind passion, and did all 
they could to restrain it, showing trust in the Christian natives
by employing them in the war, when they rendered good and 
faithful service; but the commonalty, who were in the habit of 
viewing the whole people as Hivites and Jebusites, treated these 
allies with such distrust and contumely as was quite enough to 
alienate them.</p>
<p>In July 1675, three Christian Indians were sent as guides and 
interpreters to an expedition to treat with the Indians in the 
Nipmuck country.&nbsp; One was made prisoner, but the two 
officers in command gave the fullest testimony to the good 
conduct of the other two; nevertheless they were so misused on 
their return that Mr. Gookin declared that they had been, by 
ill-treatment, &ldquo;in a manner constrained to fall off to the 
enemy.&rdquo;&nbsp; One was killed by a scouting party of praying
Indians; the other was taken, sold as a slave, and sent to 
Jamaica; and though Mr. Eliot prevailed to have him brought back,
and redeemed his wife and children, he was still kept in 
captivity.</p>
<p>The next month, August, a number of the Christian Indians were
arrested and sent up to Boston to be tried for some <!-- page 
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>murders that had been committed at Lancaster.&nbsp; 
Eliot and Gookin succeeded in proving their perfect innocence, 
but the magistrates had great difficulty in saving their lives 
from the fury of the mob, who thirsted for Indian blood, and both
minister and major were insulted and reviled, so that Gookin said
on the bench that it was not safe for him to walk in the streets;
and when Eliot met with a dangerous boat accident, wishes were 
expressed that he had been drowned.</p>
<p>Natick was looked upon with so much distrust and aversion that
Government, fearing occasions of bloodshed, decided that the 
inhabitants must be removed to Deer Island.&nbsp; On the 7th of 
October a great fast-day, with prayer and preaching, had been 
held, and fierce and bitter entreaties had been uttered against 
the Indian Sachems, especially Philip.&nbsp; One wonders whether 
Eliot&mdash;now seventy-one years old&mdash;felt it come home to 
him that he knew not what spirit he had been of when he had 
prayed for the death of the Moorish prince.&nbsp; It must have 
been a heart-breaking time for the aged man, to see the spot 
founded in so much hope and prayer, the fruit of so much care and
meditation, thus broken up and ruined, and when he was too old to
do the like work over again.&nbsp; At the end of that month of 
October, Captain Thomas Prentiss, with a party of horse and five 
or six carts, arrived at Natick, and made known the commands of 
the Government.&nbsp; Sadly but patiently the Indians 
submitted.&nbsp; Two hundred men, women, and children were made 
to get together all they could carry, and marched from their 
homes to the banks of the Charles River.&nbsp; Here, at a spot 
called the Pines, Mr. Eliot met them, and they gathered round him
to hear his words of comfort, as he exhorted them to meek 
patience, resignation, and steadiness to the faith.&nbsp; The 
scene was exceedingly affecting, as the white-haired pastor stood
by the river-side beneath the tall pines, with his dark-skinned, 
newly reclaimed children about him, clinging to him for 
consolation, but neither murmuring nor struggling, only praying 
and encouraging one another.&nbsp; Captain Prentiss and his 
soldiers were deeply touched; but at midnight, when the tide was 
high enough, three large boats bore the Indians over to Deer 
Island.&nbsp; Here they were, transplanted from their comfortable
homes in the beginning of a long and very severe winter; but, 
well divided by the river from all suspicion of doing violence, 
they fared better than the praying Indians of the <!-- page 
29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>new 
town of Wamesit.&nbsp; A barn full of hay and corn had been 
burnt, and fourteen men of Chelmsford, the next settlement, 
concluding it had been done by the Wamesit Red-skins, went 
thither, called them out of their wigwams, and then fired at 
them, killing a lad and five women and children.&nbsp; After all,
the fire had been caused by some skulking heathen Indians; but 
though the Government obtained the arrest of the murderers, the 
jury would not find them guilty.&nbsp; The Wamesit Indians fled 
into the forest, and sent a piteous letter:&mdash;&ldquo;We are 
not sorry for what we leave behind, but we are sorry that the 
English have driven us from our praying to God and from our 
teacher.&nbsp; We did begin to understand praying to God a 
<i>little</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were invited back, but were 
afraid to come till cold and hunger drove them to their old 
abode, and then the indefatigable Eliot and Gookin visited them, 
and did all in their power to bring about a better feeling 
towards them in Chelmsford.</p>
<p>This whole autumn and winter&mdash;a terribly severe 
one&mdash;seems to have been spent by these good men in trying to
heal the strifes between the English and the Indians.&nbsp; 
Wanalanset had fled, true to his father&rsquo;s policy of never 
resisting, and they were sent to invite him back again; but when 
he returned, he found that the maize grounds of his settlement 
had been ploughed up by the English and sown with rye, so that 
his tribe had most scanty subsistence.</p>
<p>Several settlements of Christians were deported to Deer 
Island.&nbsp; One large party had been made prisoners by their 
heathen countrymen and had managed to escape, but when met with 
wandering in the woods by a party of English soldiers, were 
plundered of the little the heathens had left them, in especial 
of a pewter cup, their communion plate, which Mr. Eliot had given
them, and which was much treasured by their native pastor.&nbsp; 
The General interfered in their behalf, but could not protect 
them from much ill-usage.&nbsp; The teacher was sent with his old
father and young children to Boston, where Mr. Eliot saw and 
cheered him before he was conveyed to Deer Island.&nbsp; There, 
in December, Eliot, with Gookin and other friends, frequently 
visited the Indians, now five hundred in number, and found them 
undergoing many privations, but patient, resigned, and 
unmurmuring.&nbsp; The snow was four feet deep in the woods by 
the 10th of December that year, and the exertion and exposure of 
travelling, either on snow-shoes or <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>sledges, must
have been tremendous to a man of Mr. Eliot&rsquo;s age; but he 
never seems to have intermitted his labours in carrying spiritual
and temporal succour to his people, and in endeavouring to keep 
the peace between them and the English.</p>
<p>The hard winter had had a great effect in breaking the 
strength of the enemy, and they were much more feeble on the 
renewal of the war in the spring.&nbsp; The good conduct of the 
praying Indians had overcome the popular prejudice so much that 
it was decided to employ them to assist the scanty forces of the 
English in hunting down the hostile tribes, and Gookin boasts of 
their having taken and slain more than 400 foes in the course of 
the summer of 1676, which one would scarcely think was very good 
for their recent Christianity.&nbsp; In the mean time, the 
absence of all the able-bodied men and hunters reduced their 
families to such distress that serious illness broke out among 
them, and Major Gookin caused them to be brought to the 
neighbourhood of Cambridge, where there was good fishing, and 
where he could attend to them, and provide them with food, 
clothing, and medicine.</p>
<p>In August Philip was killed, the English believing themselves 
to &ldquo;have prayed the bullet straight into his heart;&rdquo; 
and his head was carried about on a pole, in a manner we should 
have called worthy of the Indians themselves, did we not 
recollect that there were a good many city gates at home with 
much the same kind of trophy, while his wife and 
children&mdash;miserable fate!&mdash;were, like many others of 
the captives, sold into slavery to the sugar planters in 
Jamaica.</p>
<p>After this the war did not entirely cease, but the Christian 
Indians were allowed to creep back to their old settlements at 
Nonantum, and even at Natick, where Mr. Eliot continued 
periodically to visit and instruct them; but after this unhappy 
war there were only four instead of fourteen towns of Christian 
Indians in Massachusetts, and a blow had been given to his 
mission that it never recovered.</p>
<p>Still there was a splendid energy and resolution about this 
undaunted old man, now writing a narrative of the Gospel History 
in his seventy-fourth year, now sending Robert Boyle new physical
facts, now protesting hard against the cruel policy of selling 
captive Indians into slavery.&nbsp; What must not the slavery of 
the West Indian isles, which had already killed off their native 
Caribbeans, have been to these free hunters of the <!-- page 
31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>North
American forest, too proud to work for themselves, and bred in a 
climate of cold, dry, bracing air?&nbsp; And even in the West 
Indies, a shipload of these miserable creatures was refused in 
the over-stocked market, and the horrors of the slave-ship were 
prolonged across the Atlantic, till at last Mr. Eliot traced the 
unhappy freight to Tangier.&nbsp; He at once wrote to conjure the
excellent Mr. Boyle to endeavour to have them redeemed and sent 
home,&mdash;with what success, or if any were left alive, does 
not appear.</p>
<p>He had the pleasure of seeing a son of good Major Gookin 
become the minister of a district including Natick, and likewise 
of the ordination at Natick of an Indian named Daniel 
Takawombgrait.&nbsp; Of his own six children only one son and one
daughter survived him.&nbsp; Benjamin, the youngest son, was his 
coadjutor at Roxbury, and was left in charge there while he 
circulated amongst his Indians, and would have succeeded 
him.&nbsp; The loss of this son must have fallen very heavily on 
him; but &ldquo;the good old man would sometimes comfortably say,
&lsquo;I have had six children, and I bless God for His free 
grace; they are all either <i>with</i> Christ or <i>in</i> 
Christ, and my mind is now at rest concerning 
them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked how he could bear the death of such excellent 
children, his answer was, &ldquo;My desire was that they should 
have served God on earth, but if God will choose to have them 
rather serve Him in heaven, I have nothing to object against it, 
but His will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His last letter to Mr. Boyle was written in his eighty-fourth 
year, and was a farewell but a cheerful one, and he had good 
hopes then of a renewal of the spirit of missions among his 
people.&nbsp; But though his Christians did not bely their name 
in his own generation, alcohol did its work on some, consumption 
on others; and, in 1836, when Jabez Sparks wrote his biography, 
there was one wigwam at Natick inhabited by a few persons of 
mingled Indian and Negro blood, the sole living remnants of the 
foundation he had loved so well.&nbsp; Nevertheless, 
Eliot&rsquo;s work was not wasted.&nbsp; The spark he lit has 
never gone out wholly in men&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>His wife died in 1684, at a great age, and her elegy over her 
coffin were these words from himself: &ldquo;Here lies my dear 
faithful, pious, prudent, prayerful wife.&nbsp; I shall go to 
her, but she shall not return to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>He had become very feeble, and was wont to say, when 
asked how he did, &ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; I have lost everything: my 
understanding leaves me, my memory fails me, my utterance fails 
me, but, I thank God, my charity holds out still; I find that 
rather grows than fails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was forced to give up the duties of his office to a new 
pastor, and though often entreated to preach again, he would 
hardly ever do so, by reason, he said, that it would be wronging 
the souls of his people, when they had an able minister; and when
he preached for the last time on a fast day, on the 63rd Psalm, 
it was with an apology for what he called the poorness, and 
meanness, and brokenness of his meditations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;for what the 
Lord lets me live.&nbsp; He knows that now I can do nothing for 
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet he was working for Him to the utmost of his power.&nbsp; A
little boy in the neighbourhood had fallen into the fire, and 
lost his eyesight in consequence.&nbsp; The old minister took him
into his house to instruct, and first taught him to repeat many 
chapters in the Bible, and to know it so thoroughly that when 
listening to readers he could correct them if they missed a word;
after which he taught him Latin, so that an &ldquo;ordinary 
piece&rdquo; had become easy to him.</p>
<p>The importation of negro slaves had already begun, and Mr. 
Eliot &ldquo;lamented with a bleeding and a burning passion that 
the English used their negroes but as their horses or oxen, and 
that so little care was taken about their immortal souls.&nbsp; 
He look&rsquo;d upon it as a prodigy, that any bearing the name 
of Christians should so much have the heart of devils in them, as
to prevent and hinder the instruction of the poor Blackamores, 
and confine the souls of their miserable slaves to a destroying 
ignorance, merely through fear of using the benefit of their 
vassalage.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, old as he was, he induced the 
settlers around to send him their negroes on certain days of the 
week for instruction; but he had not made much progress in the 
work before he became too feeble to carry it on.&nbsp; He fell 
into languishments attended with fever, and this he viewed as his
summons.&nbsp; His successor, Mr. Nehemiah Walters, came to live 
with him, and held a good deal of conversation with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a cloud,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a dark cloud 
upon the work of the Gospel among the poor Indians.&nbsp; The 
Lord renew and prosper that work, and grant it may live when I am
dead.&nbsp; It <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>is a work which I have been doing 
much and long about.&nbsp; But what was the word I spoke 
last?&nbsp; I recall that word.&nbsp; <i>My doings</i>.&nbsp; 
Alas! they have been poor and small, and lean doings, and 
I&rsquo;ll be the man that shall throw the first stone at them 
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mather relates that he spake other words &ldquo;little short 
of oracles,&rdquo; and laments that they were not correctly 
recorded; but it appears that he gradually sank, and died in his 
eighty-seventh year of age, at Roxbury, in the year 1690.&nbsp; 
His last words were, &ldquo;Welcome joy.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; DAVID BRAINERD, THE ENTHUSIAST.</h2>
<p>The Indian pastor of Natick, who had been trained by Mr. 
Eliot, died in 1716, and two years later was born one of the men 
who did all in his power, through his brief life, to hold up the 
light of truth to the unfortunate natives of America, as they 
were driven further and further to the west before the advancing 
tide from Europe.</p>
<p>The fourth son among nine children, who lost both parents at a
very early age, David Brainerd, though born above the reach of 
want, had many disadvantages to contend with.&nbsp; Both his 
parents had, however, been religious people, the children of 
ministers who had come out to America in the days of the Pilgrim 
Fathers, and settling at Haddam in Connecticut, trained up their 
families in the stern, earnest, and rigid rules and doctrines of 
Calvinism, which certainly, where they are accepted by an earnest
and thoughtful mind, have a great tendency to stimulate the 
intellect, and force forward, as it were, the religious 
perceptions in early youth.&nbsp; David was, moreover, a delicate
child, with the seeds of (probably) hereditary decline incipient,
and at seven or eight years old he drew apart from play, thinking
much of death, and trying to prepare by prayer and 
meditation.&nbsp; His parents&rsquo; death increased these 
feelings, and while living at East Haddam, under the charge of 
his brothers, and employed <!-- page 34--><a 
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>in farm work,
the boy was continually struggling with himself in silence, 
disliking all youthful mirth and amusement, fasting, watching and
praying, and groaning over the state of his soul.&nbsp; At 
nineteen, the wish to become a minister came upon him, and he 
began to study hard at all spare moments; and in another year, at
twenty, he went to reside with Mr. Fiske, the minister of Haddam,
and in him found, for the first time, a friend to whom he could 
open his heart, who could understand the anxieties and longings 
within him, and who gave him advice to withdraw himself from the 
young companions whose gay spirits were uncongenial to him, and 
spend more time with the graver and more religious.</p>
<p>Whether this were good advice we do not know, but a period of 
terrible agony had to be struggled through.&nbsp; It seems plain,
from comparison of different lives, that in the forms of religion
which make everything depend upon the individual person&rsquo;s 
own consciousness of the state of his heart and feelings, instead
of supporting this by any outward tokens for faith to rest upon, 
the more humble and scrupulous spirits often undergo fearful 
misery before they can attain to such security of their own faith
as they believe essential.&nbsp; Indeed, this state of 
wretchedness is almost deemed a necessary stage in the Christian 
life, like the Slough of Despond in the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress;
and with such a temperament as David Brainerd&rsquo;s, the 
horrors of the struggle for hope were dreadful and lasted for 
months, before an almost physical perception of light, glory, and
grace shone out upon him, although, even to the end of his life, 
hope and fear, spiritual joy and depression alternated, no doubt,
greatly in consequence of his constant ill-health.</p>
<p>In 1739, in his twenty-first year, he became a student at 
Yale, and, between hard work and his mental self-reproach for the
worldly ambition of distinction, his health broke down, 
h&aelig;morrhage from the lungs set in, and he was sent home, it 
was supposed, only to die.&nbsp; He was then in a very happy 
frame of mind, and was almost sorry to find himself well enough 
to return to what he felt to be a scene of temptation.&nbsp; That
same year, his head was entirely turned by the excitement of 
George Whitfield&rsquo;s preaching; he was carried away by 
religious enthusiasm, and was in a state of indiscreet zeal, of 
which his better judgment afterwards repented, so that he <!-- 
page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
35</span>destroyed all the portion of his journal that related to
that year.&nbsp; Indeed, his vehemence cost him dear, for, in the
heat of a discussion, he had the misfortune to say, &ldquo;Mr. 
Whittlesey, he has no more grace than this chair I am leaning 
upon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Whittlesey was one of the college tutors, 
and a gossiping freshman who overheard the words thought proper 
to report this to a meddling woman, who immediately walked off to
the Rector of the college with the awful intelligence that young 
Brainerd said that Mr. Whittlesey had no more grace than a 
chair!</p>
<p>The Rector had not the sense to silence the silly slander; he 
sent for the freshman, took his evidence, and that of the young 
men with whom Brainerd had been conversing, and then required him
to make public confession and amends to Mr. Whittlesey before the
whole assembled college,&mdash;a humiliation never previously 
required, except in cases of gross moral misconduct.&nbsp; The 
fact was, that the old-fashioned hereditary Presbyterianism, 
which had had time to slacken in the hundred years since the 
foundation of the colony, was dismayed at the new and vivid life 
imported by Whitfield from the Wesleyan revival in the English 
Church.&nbsp; It was what always happens.&nbsp; A mixture of 
genuine sober-minded dread of extravagance, or new doctrine, and 
a sluggish distaste to the more searching religion, combine to 
lead to a spirit of persecution.&nbsp; This was the true reason 
that the lad&rsquo;s youthful rashness of speech was treated as 
so grave an offence.&nbsp; Brainerd&rsquo;s spirit was up.&nbsp; 
Probably he saw no cause to alter his opinion as to Mr. 
Whittlesey&rsquo;s amount of grace, and he stoutly refused to 
retract his words, whereupon he was found guilty of 
insubordination, and actually expelled from Yale.&nbsp; A council
of ministers who assembled at Hartford petitioned for his 
restoration, but were refused, the authorities deeming themselves
well rid of a dangerous fanatic.</p>
<p>Still, as a youth of blameless life and ardent piety, he was 
encouraged by his friends to continue his preparation for the 
ministry, and he persisted in reading hard, and going out between
whiles to meditate in the depths of the glorious woods.&nbsp; It 
is curious that while his homely and rigid system precluded any 
conscious admiration of the beauties of nature, it is always 
evident from his journal that the lightenings of hope and joy 
which relieved his too frequent depression and melancholy, <!-- 
page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
36</span>were connected with the scenery and the glories of day 
and night.&nbsp; Sunrise and the aurora borealis seem to have 
filled him with spiritual bliss, and he never was so happy as 
when deep in the woods, out of the sight of men; but his morbid, 
sensitive, excitable nature never seems to have been understood 
by himself or by others.</p>
<p>Just as John Eliot&rsquo;s missionary zeal was the outcome of 
the earnestness that carried the Puritans to New England, so the 
fresh infusion of religious life, brought by Whitfield, produced 
an ardent desire on the part of David Brainerd to devote himself 
to the remainder of the Indians; and in the year 1742, at 
twenty-five years old, he was examined by an assembly of 
ministers at Danbury, and licensed to preach the Gospel, when he 
began at once with a little settlement of Indians at Kent, with 
such a sinking of heart at his own unworthiness that he says he 
seemed to himself worse than any devil, and almost expected to 
have been stoned rather than listened to.&nbsp; Indeed, something
of this diffidence and sadness seems always to have weighed him 
down when he began to preach, though the fervour of his subject 
and the responding faces of his audience always exhilarated him 
and bore him up through his sermon.&nbsp; To learn the Indian 
language had not occurred to him as part of his preparation, but 
probably these Kent Red men had been enough among the English to 
understand him, for they seem to have been much impressed.</p>
<p>A Scottish Society for propagating Christian Knowledge had 
arisen, and the delegates hearing of the zeal of David Brainerd, 
desired to engage him at a salary.&nbsp; The sense of his own 
unworthiness, and fear of keeping out a better man, brought his 
spirits down to the lowest ebb; nevertheless, he went to meet the
representatives of the Society at New York, and there, though 
between the hubbub of the town and his own perpetual 
self-condemnation he was continually wretched, they were so well 
satisfied with him as to give him the appointment, on condition 
that he studied the language, intending to send him to the Red 
men between the Susquehanna and the Delaware; but there was a 
dispute between these and the Government, and it was decided to 
send him to a settlement called Kanaumeek, between Stockbridge 
and Albany.</p>
<p>Before going, David Brainerd, having no thought beyond 
devotion to the Indians, and thinking his allowance enough <!-- 
page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>for his wants, gave up the whole of his inheritance to 
support a scholar at the University, and set forth, undaunted by 
such weakness of health as in ordinary eyes would have fitted him
for nothing but to be carefully nursed; for even then he was 
continually suffering from pain and dizziness, and weakness so 
great that he could often hardly stand.</p>
<p>In this state he arrived at Kanaumeek, with a young Indian to 
act as his interpreter, and there spent the first night sleeping 
on a heap of straw.&nbsp; It was a lonely, melancholy spot, where
the Indians were herded together, watched with jealous eyes by 
adventurers who were always endeavouring to seize their lands, 
and sadly degenerated from the free, grave, high-spirited men to 
whom Eliot had preached.&nbsp; His first lodging was in the log 
house of a poor Scotchman who lived among the Indians&mdash;a 
single chamber, without so much as a floor, and where he shared 
the family meals upon porridge, boiled corn, and 
girdle-cakes.&nbsp; The family spoke Gaelic, only the master of 
the house knowing any English, and that not so good as the Indian
interpreter&rsquo;s; and, moreover, the spot was a mile and a 
half from the Indian wigwams, no small consideration to so weakly
a man, thus poorly fed.&nbsp; However, the Indians were pleased 
with his addresses, and seemed touched by them; but the evil 
habits of the White men were the terrible stumbling-block.&nbsp; 
Parties of them would come into the town, and vex the 
missionary&rsquo;s ears with their foul tongues, making a 
scandalous contrast to the grave, calm manners of the 
Indians.&nbsp; More than ever did he love solitude, and when with
his own hands he had built himself a log hut, where he could be 
alone when he pleased, his relief was great.</p>
<p>He was not the highly educated scholar and practical theorist 
that his predecessor had been: he seems to have had no plans or 
systems, and merely to have tried to fulfil immediate needs; but 
he soon found that he could not hope to benefit his Red flock 
without a school, so he made a journey to New Jersey to entreat 
for means to set one up, and this was done, with his interpreter 
as master.&nbsp; His journey was made on horseback, and was no 
small undertaking, for even between Stockbridge and Kanaumeek he 
had once lost his way, and had to sleep a night in the woods.</p>
<p>He had by this time thoroughly repented of the 
uncharitableness and hastiness of his speech about Mr. 
Whittlesey, and <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>he took a journey to New Haven to 
send in a thoroughly humble and Christian-like apology, 
requesting to be permitted to take his degree.&nbsp; Twice he was
refused, and the third time was told that the only condition on 
which the degree would be granted would be the making up his term
of residence at Yale, which was, of course, not possible to a 
licensed minister in full employment, and in fact was an 
insulting proposal to a man of his standing and character.</p>
<p>His journey cost him dear, for as he was riding home he was 
attacked with violent pain in the face and shiverings, which 
forced him to halt at the first shelter he could find, happily 
with kind friends, who nursed him for a fortnight before he could
return home.&nbsp; He believed that had his illness seized him in
his log house at home, he must certainly have died for want of 
care and attendance, although he was much beloved by his poor 
Indians.</p>
<p>His life was indeed a frightfully hard one, and would have 
been so for a healthy man; for he had to work with his own hands 
to store provisions for his horse in the winter, and that when 
weak and suffering the more for want of proper food.&nbsp; He 
could get no bread but by riding ten or fifteen miles to procure 
it, and if he brought home too much it became mouldy and sour, 
while, if he brought home a small quantity, he could not go for 
more if he failed to catch his horse, which was turned out to 
graze in the woods; so that he was reduced to making little cakes
of Indian meal, which he fried in the ashes.&nbsp; &ldquo;And 
then,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I blessed God as if I had been a 
king.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a house and many of the comforts
of life to support me,&rdquo; he says with great satisfaction; 
and the solitude of that house was so precious to him that, 
however weary he was, he would ride back twenty miles to it at 
night rather than spend an evening among ungodly men.&nbsp; By 
this terrible stinting of what we should deem the necessaries of 
life, he was actually able, in fifteen months, to devote a 
hundred pounds to charitable purposes, besides keeping the young 
man at the University.</p>
<p>So much, however, did he love his solitude, that he counted it
as no relief, but an affliction, to have to ride to Stockbridge 
from time to time to learn the Indian language from Mr. Sergeant,
the missionary there stationed.&nbsp; Something of this must have
been morbid feeling, something from the want of energy consequent
on the condition of his frame.&nbsp; For a man <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>in confirmed 
decline such an entry in a journal as this is no 
trifle:&mdash;&ldquo;December 20.&mdash;Rode to 
Stockbridge.&nbsp; Was very much fatigued with my journey, 
wherein I underwent great hardship; was much exposed, and very 
wet by falling into a river.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Sergeant could 
hardly have been profane company, but Brainerd never enjoyed 
these visits, thinking that intercourse with the world made him 
less familiar with heaven.</p>
<p>Another inconvenience was the proximity of Kanaumeek to the 
frontier, and these were the days of that horrid war between 
England and France in America, when the native allies of each 
nation made savage descents on the outlying settlements, 
inflicting all the flagrant outrages of their wild warfare.&nbsp;
A message came one evening to Kanaumeek from Colonel Stoddart, 
warning all in exposed situations to secure themselves as well as
possible, since an attack might come at any moment; and this 
Brainerd quietly records as a salutary warning not to attach 
himself too much to the <i>comforts of life</i> he enjoyed.</p>
<p>The attack was never made, but he came to the conclusion that 
his small congregation of Indians would be much better with their
fellows at Stockbridge under the care of Mr. Sergeant, and that 
this would leave him free to go to more wild and untaught 
tribes.&nbsp; It was carried out, and the Indians removed.&nbsp; 
There was much mutual love between them and their pastor, and the
parting was very affectionate, though even after two years he was
still unable to speak the language, and never seems to have 
troubled himself about this trifling obstacle.&nbsp; Several 
English congregations entreated him to become their minister, but
he refused them all, and went to meet the Commissioners of the 
Scottish Society at New Jersey.&nbsp; They arranged with him for 
a mission to the Delaware Indians, in spite of his being laid up 
for some days at the time; and when he went back to Kanaumeek to 
dispose of his books and other &ldquo;comforts,&rdquo; the 
effects of being drenched with rain showed themselves in 
continued bleeding from the lungs.&nbsp; He knew that he was 
often in an almost dying state, and only wished to continue in 
his Master&rsquo;s service to the end he longed for.&nbsp; He 
owns that his heart did sometimes sink at the thought of going 
alone into the wilderness; but he thought of Abraham, and took 
courage, riding alone through the depths of the forest, so 
desolate and lonely day after day, that it struck terror even 
into his soul.&nbsp; There were scanty settlements of Dutch and 
Irish, where he sometimes <!-- page 40--><a 
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>spent a 
night, but the Sunday he passed among some Irish was so entirely 
unmarked by them, that he felt like a &ldquo;creature banished 
from the sight of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last he reached his destination on the fork of the river 
Delaware, and being within moderate distance of Newark, there 
received ordination as a minister on the 11th of June, 
1744.&nbsp; Severe illness followed the exertion of preaching and
praying before the convened ministers; but as soon as he could 
walk, he set forth on his return, though he was so weak that he 
could hardly open his numbed hand, but his heart and hopes had 
begun to revive, and the little settlement of Whites with whom he
lived were willing to listen to him.</p>
<p>The Indians were in the midst of preparing for an idolatrous 
feast and dance.&nbsp; Brainerd spent a day in the woods in an 
anguish of prayer, and then went to the place of meeting, where, 
stranger as he was, he prevailed on them to cease their revels 
and attend to him.</p>
<p>His biographer, President Jonathan Edwards, provokingly leaves
out his method of teaching, &ldquo;for the sake of 
brevity,&rdquo; and from his own diary little is to be gathered 
but accounts of his state of feeling through endless journeyings 
and terrible prostrations of strength.&nbsp; He was always 
travelling about&mdash;now to the Susquehanna, now back to New 
England&mdash;apparently at times with the restlessness of 
disease, for this roving about must have prevented him from ever 
deepening the impression made by his preaching, which after all 
was only through an interpreter, for he never gave himself time 
to learn the language.</p>
<p>Yet after some months he did find a settlement of Indians, 
about eighty miles from the fork of Delaware, at a place called 
Crossweeksung, who were far more disposed to attend to him.&nbsp;
They listened so eagerly, that day after day they would travel 
after him from village to village, hardly taking any heed to 
secure provisions for themselves.&nbsp; The description of their 
conduct is like that of those touched by Wesleyan 
preaching.&nbsp; They threw themselves on the ground, wept 
bitterly, and prayed aloud, with the general enthusiasm of 
excitement, though, he expressly says, without fainting or 
convulsions, and even the White men around, who came to scoff, 
were deeply impressed.</p>
<p>David Brainerd had at last his hour of bliss!&nbsp; He was 
delivered from his melancholy by the joy of such results, and in 
trembling <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>happiness baptized his converts in 
the river beside their wigwams before leaving them to proceed to 
a village on the Susquehanna, where he hoped for an interview 
with the chief Sachem of the Delawares.</p>
<p>The place, however, was in the wildest confusion and uproar, 
it being the period of a great festival, when every one was too 
tipsy to attend to him.&nbsp; At an island called Juneauta, he 
met a very remarkable personage, a Powaw, who bore the reputation
of a reformer, anxious to restore the ancient religion of the Red
man, which had become corrupted by intercourse with the White and
his vices.</p>
<p>His aspect was the most dreadful thing Brainerd had ever 
seen.&nbsp; He wore a shaggy bearskin coat, hood, and stockings, 
and a hideous, painted mask, so that no part of his person was 
visible, not even the hand in which he held an instrument made of
the shell of a tortoise, with dry corn within, and he came up 
rattling this, and dancing with all his might, and with such 
gesticulations that, though assured that he intended no injury, 
it was impossible not to shrink back as this savage creature came
close.</p>
<p>Yet he was a thoughtful man, such as would have been a 
philosopher in ancient Greece or Rome.&nbsp; He took the 
missionary into his hut, and conversed long and earnestly with 
him.&nbsp; He had revolted in spirit from the degradation of his 
countrymen, and had gone to live apart in the woods, where he had
worked out a system of natural religion for himself, which he 
believed the Great Spirit had taught him, and which had at last 
led him to return to his people and endeavour to restore them to 
that purity which of course he believed to have once 
existed.&nbsp; He believed there were good men somewhere, and he 
meant to wander till he found them; meantime, he was kindly to 
all who came near him, and constantly uplifted his testimony 
against their vices, especially when the love of strong drink was
brought among them.&nbsp; When all was in vain, he would go 
weeping away into the woods, and hide himself there till the 
hateful fire-water was all consumed and the madness over.&nbsp; 
Brainerd was greatly touched by this red-skinned Epictetus, who, 
he said, had more honesty, sincerity, and conscientiousness than 
he had ever met with in an Indian, and more of the temper of true
religion; and he expounded to him the Christian doctrine with 
great carefulness and double earnestness.&nbsp; The <!-- page 
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
42</span>self-taught philosopher broke in now and then with 
&ldquo;Now that I like,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;So the Great Spirit 
has taught me;&rdquo; but when the missionary came to the regions
where faith surpasses the power of the intellect and the moral 
sense, the Indian would not follow him, and rejected his 
teaching.&nbsp; It was curious that he particularly denied the 
idea of a devil, declaring that there was no such being, 
according to the ancient Indians.&nbsp; Now, the incantations of 
the Powaws were generally supposed to be addressed to evil 
spirits, and probably the perception of the falsehood of these 
pretended rites led to his disclaiming the Christian 
doctrine.</p>
<p>Whether time and further teaching would have overpowered his 
belief in his own inspiration does not appear, for Brainerd found
the Indians too vicious and hardened to pay the least heed either
to him or to their own reformer; and he went back to 
Crossweeksung, where his flock was still increasing, and in a 
most satisfactory condition, renouncing their heathen customs and
their acquired vice of drunkenness, and practising some amount of
industry.&nbsp; A school was set up, old and young learnt 
English, the children in three or four months could read the 
Bible in English, and Brainerd&rsquo;s sermons and prayers were 
understood without an interpreter.</p>
<p>This improved condition of the Indians destroyed the shameful 
profits of the nearest settlement of Whites, whose practice it 
had hitherto been to entice them to drink, and then run up a 
heavy score against them for liquor.&nbsp; Finding that all 
endeavours to seduce them into drunkenness were now vain, these 
wretches first tried to raise the country against Brainerd, by 
reporting that he was a Roman Catholic in disguise; and when this
failed, they laid claim to the lands of Crossweeksung, in 
discharge of debts that they declared to have been previously 
contracted.&nbsp; Fortunately, Brainerd had it in his power to 
advance 82<i>l.</i> from his private means, so as to save his 
people from this extortion; but he afterwards thought it best to 
remove them from these dangerous neighbours to a new settlement, 
fifteen miles off, called Cranberry.&nbsp; He remained himself in
his little hut at Crossweeksung, after they had proceeded to 
raise wigwams and prepare the ground for maize; but, whenever he 
rode over to visit them, his approach was notified by the sound 
of a conch shell, and they all gathered round for his prayers and
instruction.</p>
<p><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
43</span>His success with them seems to have greatly cured his 
depression of spirits, but his mind was balancing between the 
expedience of remaining among them as their permanent pastor, 
protector, and guide, and that of striving to extend the kingdom 
of faith.&nbsp; Sometimes he liked the prospect of a settled home
and repose, study and meditation; but, at the thought of gaining 
souls to Christ, all these considerations melted before him, and 
he believed that he was marked out for the life of a pilgrim and 
hermit by his carelessness about hardships.</p>
<p>He had not, however, taken leave of his flock when he set 
forth on another expedition to the obdurate Indians of the 
Susquehanna, in the September of 1746.&nbsp; It was without 
result; he could obtain no attention, and the hardships of the 
journey, the night exposure, and the frequent drenchings 
completed the wreck of his health.&nbsp; He came back with night 
perspirations, bleeding from the lungs, and suffering greatly, 
feverish and coughing, and often in pain; yet, whenever he could 
mount his horse, riding the fifteen miles to attend to the 
Indians at Cranberry, or sitting in a chair before his hut, when 
they assembled round him.</p>
<p>On Sunday he persisted in preaching, till generally at the end
of half an hour he fainted, and was carried to his bed; and at 
the administration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper he was carried to 
the place where he had forty Indian communicants, and likewise 
some Whites, who had learnt to reverence him, and who supported 
him back to his bed.&nbsp; He was quite happy now, for he felt he
had done all he could to the utmost of his strength; but, soon 
becoming totally unable to speak at all, he felt that he must do 
what he called &ldquo;consuming some time in diversions,&rdquo; 
and try to spend the winter in a civilized place.</p>
<p>After riding his first short stage, however, his illness 
increased so much, that he was quite incapable of proceeding or 
returning, and remained in a friend&rsquo;s house at 
Elizabethtown, suffering from cough, asthma, and fever the whole 
winter.&nbsp; In March 1747 he had rallied enough to ride to 
Cranberry, where he went from hut to hut, giving advice to and 
praying with each family, and parting with them with great 
tenderness.&nbsp; Tears were shed everywhere; for, though he 
still hoped to return, all felt that they should see his face no 
more!&nbsp; But, to his great comfort and joy, his poor people 
were not to be abandoned to <!-- page 44--><a 
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>themselves 
and their tempters.&nbsp; His younger 
brother&mdash;John&mdash;relieved his mind by offering to assume 
the care of them, and under his pastorship he could thankfully 
leave them.</p>
<p>In April he set out again on his journey, at the rate of about
ten miles a day, riding all the way, and on the 28th of May 
arrived at Northampton, where Jonathan Edwards, afterwards 
President of the College of New Jersey, was then minister.&nbsp; 
They were like-minded men, both disciples of Whitfield, and the 
self-devoted piety of the young missionary was already so well 
known to Mr. Edwards by report, that it was most gladly that he 
received him into his house and family.&nbsp; There the 
impression Brainerd made was of a singularly social, entertaining
person, meek and unpretending, but manly and independent.&nbsp; 
Probably rest and brightness had come when the terrible struggle 
of his early years had ceased, and morbid despondency had given 
way to Christian hope, for he became at once a bright and 
pleasant member of any society where he formed a part, and to the
Edwards family he was like a son or brother.&nbsp; When he was 
able, Mr. Edwards wished him to lead the family devotions, and 
was always greatly impressed by the manner and matter of his 
prayers, but one petition never failed, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;that 
we might not outlive our usefulness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even in saying 
grace there was always something about him that struck the 
attention.</p>
<p>His purpose in coming to Northampton had been to consult Dr. 
Mather, whose verdict was that he was far gone in decline, and 
who gave him no advice but to ride as much as possible.&nbsp; So 
little difference did this sentence make to him that he never 
noted it in his diary, though he spoke of it cheerily in the 
Edwards family&mdash;a large household of young 
people&mdash;where he was so much beloved, that when he decided 
to go to Boston, Jerusha, the second daughter, entreated to be 
allowed to accompany him, to nurse him as his sister would have 
done.</p>
<p>The pure, severe simplicity of those early American manners 
was such, that no one seems to have been surprised at a girl of 
eighteen becoming the attendant of a man of twenty-nine.&nbsp; 
Jerusha had the full consent and approbation of her parents, and 
she was a great comfort and delight to him.&nbsp; He told her 
father that she was more spiritual, self denying, and earnest to 
do good, than any young person he had ever known; and on <!-- 
page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>doubt their communings were far above earth, hovering, 
as he was well known to be, upon the very borders of the 
grave.</p>
<p>They took four days to reach Boston, and there he was received
with the greatest respect by all the ministers; but, a week after
his arrival, so severe an attack of his illness came on that he 
became delirious, and was thought to be at the point of 
death.&nbsp; Again, however, he came back enough to life to sit 
up in bed and write ardent letters of counsel to the brother who 
had succeeded him among his Indians, and likewise to give his 
friends the assurance of his perfect peace and joy.&nbsp; He said
that he had carefully examined himself, and though he had found 
much pride, selfishness, and corruption, he was still certain 
that he had felt it his greatest happiness to glorify and praise 
God; and this certainty, together with his faith in the Redeemer,
had calmed all the anguish he had suffered for years.</p>
<p>Whenever he was able to converse he had numerous visitors, 
especially from the deputies of the Society in London which had 
assisted Eliot.&nbsp; A legacy for the support of two 
missionaries had newly been received, and his counsel on the mode
of employing it was asked.&nbsp; He was able to strive to imbue 
others with the same zeal as himself, and to do much on behalf of
his own mission, although he often lay so utterly exhausted that 
he said of himself that he could not understand how life could be
retained.&nbsp; One of his brothers, a student at Yale, came to 
see him, and to tell him of the death of his favourite sister, of
whose illness he had not even heard, but it was no shock to him, 
for he felt far more sure of meeting her again than if she had 
been left on earth.</p>
<p>The summer weather, to the surprise of all, brought back a 
slight revival of strength, and some of his friends began to hope
he might yet recover, but he knew his own state too well, and 
told them he was as assuredly a dead man as if he had been shot 
through the heart; still he was resolved to profit by this 
partial restoration to return to Northampton, chiefly because the
rumour had reached him that the Bostonians had intended to give 
him such a funeral as should testify their great esteem; and 
being disappointed in this, they intended to assemble and escort 
him publicly, while still alive, out of their city, but the bare 
idea naturally made him so unhappy that they were forced to give 
it up.</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
46</span>Five days were spent in the journey, and again the 
Edwardses reverentially opened their doors to a guest so near 
heaven.&nbsp; For some time he rode out two or three miles daily,
and sat with the family, writing or conversing cheerfully when 
not engaged in prayer.&nbsp; His brother John came from 
Crossweeksung and cheered him with a good account of his Indians;
and hearing of the great need of another school, he wrote to the 
friends who had shown themselves so warmly interested in him at 
Boston, and was gratified by their reply, with a subscription of 
200<i>l.</i> for the purpose, and of 75<i>l.</i> for the mission 
to the Six Nations.&nbsp; His answers were written with his own 
hand; but he had become so much weaker that he felt this his last
task.&nbsp; He had been one who, in his short life, had sown in 
tears to reap in joy.</p>
<p>He was sinking fast as the autumn cold came on, often talking 
tenderly to the little ones of the house, but suffering terribly 
at times, and sighing, &ldquo;Why is His chariot so long 
coming?&rdquo; then blaming himself for over-haste to be 
released.</p>
<p>He had a smile for Jerusha as she came into his room on Sunday
morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you willing to part with me?&nbsp; I am
willing to part with you, though if I thought I could not see you
and be happy with you in another world, I could not bear to 
part.&nbsp; I am willing to leave all my friends.&nbsp; I am 
willing to leave my brother, though I love him better than any 
creature living.&nbsp; I have committed him and all my friends to
God, and can leave them with God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, looking at the Bible in her hands, he said, 
&ldquo;Oh that dear Book! the mysteries in it and in God&rsquo;s 
providence will soon be unfolded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lingered in great agony at times till the 9th of October, 
1747, when came a cessation of pain, and during this lull he 
breathed his last, then wanting six months of his thirtieth 
birthday.&nbsp; He had told Jerusha that they should soon meet 
above, and, in effect, she only lived until the next 
February.&nbsp; She told her father on her death-bed, that for 
years past she had not seen the time when she had any wish to 
live a moment longer, save for the sake of doing good and filling
up the measure of her duty.</p>
<p>David Brainerd&rsquo;s career ended at an age when John 
Eliot&rsquo;s had not begun.&nbsp; It was a very wonderful 
struggle between the frail suffering body and the devoted, 
resolute spirit, both <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>weighed down by the natural morbid 
temper, further depressed by the peculiar tenets of the form of 
doctrine in which he had been bred.&nbsp; The prudent, 
well-weighed measures of the ripe scholar, studious theologian, 
and conscientious politician, formed by forty-two years&rsquo; 
experience of an old and a new country, could not be looked for 
in the sickly, self-educated, enthusiastic youth who had been 
debarred from the due amount of study, and started with little 
system but that of &ldquo;proclaiming the 
Gospel&rdquo;&mdash;even though ignorant of the language of those
to whom he preached.&nbsp; And yet that heart-whole piety and 
patience was blessed with a full measure of present success, and 
David Brainerd&rsquo;s story, though that of a short life, 
over-clouded by mental distress, hardship, and sickness, fills us
with the joyful sense that there is One that giveth the 
victory.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; CHRISTIAN FRIEDRICH SCHWARTZ, THE 
COUNCILLOR OF TANJORE.</h2>
<p>We must turn from America to the warmer regions of the East, 
from the patriarchal savage to complicated forms of society, and 
from the Red-skin to the Hindoo&mdash;a man of far nearer 
affinity to ourselves, being, like us, of the great Indo-European
race, speaking a language like our own, an altered, corrupted, 
and intermingled dialect of the same original tongue, and his 
ancestors originally professing a religion in which the same 
primary ideas may be traced as those which were held by our 
ancient northern forefathers, and which are familiar to us in the
graceful dress imposed on them by the Greeks.&nbsp; The sacred 
writings of the Hindoos form the earliest storehouse of the words
of our common language, and the thoughts therein found, though 
recorded after the branches had parted from the common stock, are
nearer the universal germ than those to be found anywhere else, 
and more nearly represent the primary notion of religion held by 
the race of Japheth, after that of Shem, to which God revealed 
Himself more distinctly, had parted from it.&nbsp; These oldest 
writings <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>are quaint, pure, and simple, but on 
them the fancies of a race enervated by climate engrafted much 
that was hideous, monstrous, and loathsome, leading to gross 
idolatry, and much vice perpetrated in the name of 
religion.&nbsp; Mythology always degenerates with the popular 
character, and then, so far as the character is formed by the 
religious faith, the mythology helps to debase it further, until 
the undying moral sense of conscience awakens again in some man, 
or band of men, and a new morality arises; sometimes grafted upon
philosophic reasoning, sometimes upon a newly-invented or freshly
introduced religion.</p>
<p>Thus, when Hindooism had become corrupt, the deeply meditative
system of Buddha was introduced into many parts of India, and 
certainly brought a much higher theory and purer code than that 
founded on the garbled nature-worship of ancient India; but both 
religions co-existed, and, indeed, Buddhism was in one aspect an 
offshoot of the Hindoo faith.</p>
<p>Christianity&mdash;planted, as is believed, by St. Thomas, on 
the Malabar coast&mdash;never became wholly extinct, although 
tinged with Nestorianism, but it was never adopted by the natives
at large, and the learning and philosophy of the Brahmins would 
have required the utmost powers of the most learned fathers of 
the Church to cope with them, before they could have been 
convinced.</p>
<p>The rigid distinctions of caste have made it more difficult 
for the Church which &ldquo;preaches the Gospel to the 
poor,&rdquo; to be accepted in India than anywhere else.&nbsp; 
Accounting himself sprung from the head of Brahma, the Brahmin 
deems himself, and is deemed by others, as lifted to an elevation
which has no connection either with moral goodness, with wealth, 
or with power; and which is as much the due of the most 
poverty-stricken and wicked member of the caste as of the most 
magnificent priest.&nbsp; The Sudras, the governing and warlike 
class, are next in order, having sprung from the god&rsquo;s 
breast, and beneath these come infinite grades of caste, their 
subdivisions each including every man of each trade or calling 
which he pursues hereditarily and cannot desert or change, save 
under the horrible penalty of losing caste, and becoming forsaken
and despised of every creature, even the nearest kindred.&nbsp; 
The mere eating from a vessel used to contain food for a person 
of a different caste is enough to produce contamination; <!-- 
page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>the separation is complete, and the whole constitution 
of body and mind have become so inured to the distinction, that 
the cost of becoming a convert is infinitely severer in India 
than ever it could have been even in Greece or Rome, where, 
though the Christian might be persecuted even to the death, he 
was not thrust out of the pale of humanity like a Hindoo convert 
who transgresses caste.</p>
<p>The Christians of Malabar are a people living to themselves, 
and the great Bengalee nations never appear to have had the 
Gospel carried to them.&nbsp; The Mahometan conquest filled India
with professors of the faith of the Koran; but these were a 
dominant race, proud and separate from the mass of people, whom 
they did not win to their faith, and thus the Hindoo idolatry had
prevailed untouched for almost the whole duration of the world, 
when the wealth of India in the early days of naval enterprise 
first began to tempt small mercantile companies of Europeans to 
form factories on the coast merely for purposes of traffic, 
without at first any idea that these would lead to possession or 
conquest, and, in general, without any sense of the 
responsibility of coming as Christians into a heathen world.</p>
<p>The Portuguese did indeed strive earnestly to Christianize 
their territory at Goa; and they promoted by all means in their 
power the labours of Francisco Xavier and his Jesuit companions, 
so effectually that the fruits of their teaching have remained to
the present day.</p>
<p>Neither were the Dutch, who then held Ceylon, entirely 
careless of the duty of instructing their subjects; and the 
Danes, who had obtained the town of Tranquebar on the Coromandel 
coast, in 1746, sent out a mission which was vigorously 
conducted, and met with good success.&nbsp; Hitherto, however, 
the English at Madras and Calcutta had been almost wholly 
indifferent, and it must be remembered that theirs was not a 
Government undertaking.&nbsp; The East India Company was still 
only a struggling corporation of merchants and traders, who only 
wanted to secure the warehouses and dwellings of those who 
conducted their traffic, and had as yet no thought of anything 
but the security of their trade; often, indeed, considering 
themselves pledged to no interference with the religion of the 
people around, and too often forgetting their own.&nbsp; However,
the Danish mission received grants of <!-- page 50--><a 
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>money and 
books from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; and the
first Indian missionary of any note, a German by birth, was 
equally connected with both England and Denmark.</p>
<p>Sonnenburg in Brandenburg, still an electorate at the time, 
was the native home of Christian Friedrich Schwartz, of whose 
parents it is only known that they appear to have been in easy 
circumstances, and that his mother, who died before he could 
remember, told her husband and her pastor on her death-bed, that 
she had dedicated her infant to the service of God, imploring 
them to cherish and forward any inclination towards the 
ministerial office that might be visible in him.&nbsp; It was, of
course, the Lutheran form in which the child of this pious woman 
was bred up, and in 1734 he was sent to the grammar school of 
Sonnenburg, where his piety was first excited by a religious 
master, then cooled by an indifferent one; and he was then taken 
by his father, walking on foot the whole way, to pursue his 
studies at Custrin.&nbsp; There he became beset by the 
temptations that surrounded young students, and after giving way 
to them for a time, was saved from further evil by the influence 
of the daughter of one of the Syndics.&nbsp; It does not appear 
to have been a matter of sentiment, but of honest friendship and 
good counsel, aiding the young man to follow his better instead 
of his worse impulses; and thus giving a labourer to the 
vineyard.</p>
<p>Before residing at Custrin, this lady had lived for a time at 
Halle, and what she told the young Schwartz of the professors at 
that university, inspired him with the desire of completing his 
course under them, especially August Hermann Francke, who had 
established an admirable orphan house, with an excellent grammar 
school.</p>
<p>In his twentieth year, Schwartz entered at Halle, but lodged 
at the orphan house, where he became teacher to the Latin 
classes, and was put in charge of the evening devotions of the 
household.&nbsp; At Halle, he met a retired Danish missionary, 
named Schultz, who had come thither to superintend the printing 
of a version of the Bible in Tamul, the language of Ceylon and of
the Coromandel coast; and this it was that first turned his mind 
to the thought of offering himself as a worker in the great field
of India.</p>
<p>He was the eldest of the family, and his friends all declared 
<!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>that it was impossible that his father should consent to
part with him; but when he went home, and earnestly stated his 
desire, the elder Schwartz, instead of at once refusing as all 
expected, desired to take three days to consider; and when they 
were passed, he came gravely down from his chamber, called his 
son Christian, gave him his blessing, and told him to depart in 
God&rsquo;s name, charging him to forget his own country and his 
father&rsquo;s house, and to win many souls to Christ.</p>
<p>And certainly that good old German&rsquo;s blessing went forth
with his son.&nbsp; Christian Schwartz next resigned his share in
the family property to his brothers and sisters; and after 
completing his studies at Halle, went to Copenhagen, since it was
by the Danish government that he was to be authorized.&nbsp; Two 
other young Germans, named Poltzenheigen and Hutteman, went with 
him.&nbsp; The Danes, though Lutherans in profession, have an 
Episcopal hierarchy, and the three students were ordained by the 
Danish Bishop Horreboa on the 6th of September, 1749; Christian 
Schwartz being then within a month of twenty-three.</p>
<p>Their first stage was to England, where they had to learn the 
language, and were entertained at the cost of the Society for 
Promoting Christian Knowledge.&nbsp; Mr. Ziegenhagen, German 
chaplain to George II., was very kind to his countrymen, helped 
them in all their difficulties, and gave them directions for 
which they were very grateful.&nbsp; He made them preach in the 
Chapel Royal on Christmas Day.&nbsp; No doubt the language was 
German, which must have been acceptable to the Hanoverian 
ears.</p>
<p>Their English studies were not greatly prolonged, for they 
arrived on the 8th of December, 1749, and sailed on the 29th of 
January, 1750, in an East India Company&rsquo;s ship, where they 
were allowed a free passage, and were treated with respect and 
friendliness.&nbsp; The voyage lasted long enough to improve them
in English, for they did not cast anchor at Tranquebar till the 
8th of October.</p>
<p>At this considerable Danish factory, they were received into 
the mission-house of the Danes, and there remained while studying
the language, in which Schwartz made so much progress that he 
preached his first Tamul sermon only four months after his 
arrival, and by the spring was able to catechize the children who
attended the school.&nbsp; This station at Tranquebar <!-- page 
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>formed the home of seven or eight missionaries, who 
lived together, attended to the services and schools, prepared 
candidates for baptism, and made excursions by ones and twos into
the villages that stood thickly on the coast, where they talked 
and argued with the natives, hoping to incite them to inquire 
further.&nbsp; The two greatest obstacles they met with here were
the evil example of Europeans and the difficulty of maintenance 
for a convert.&nbsp; One poor dancing girl said, on hearing that 
no unholy person could enter into the kingdom of heaven, 
&ldquo;Ah! sir, then no European will;&rdquo; but, on the whole, 
they must have met with good success, for in 1752 there were 
three large classes of catechumens prepared and baptized at the 
station.&nbsp; In the district around there were several 
villages, where congregations of Christians existed, and, of all 
those south of the river Caveri, Schwartz was after two more 
years made the superintendent.</p>
<p>The simple habits of these German and Danish clergy eminently 
fitted them for such journeys; they set out in pairs on foot, 
after a farewell of united prayer from their brethren, carrying 
with them their Hebrew Bibles, and attended by a few Christian 
servants and coolies; they proceeded from village to village, 
sometimes sleeping in the house of a Hindoo merchant, sometimes 
at that of one the brother ministers they had come to see, and at
every halt conversing and arguing with Hindoo or Mahometan, or 
sometimes with the remnants of the Christians converted by the 
Portuguese, who had been so long neglected that they had little 
knowledge of any faith.</p>
<p>The character of Christian Schwartz was one to influence all 
around him.&nbsp; He seems to have had all the quiet German 
patience and endurance of hardship, without much excitability, 
and with a steadiness of judgment and intense honesty and 
integrity, that disposed every one to lean on him and rely on him
for their temporal as well as their spiritual matters&mdash;great
charity and warmth of heart, and a shrewdness of perception that 
made him excellent in argument.&nbsp; He had also that true 
missionary gift, a great facility of languages, both in grammar 
and pronunciation, and his utter absence of all regard for his 
own comfort or selfish dignity, yet his due respect to times and 
places made him able to penetrate everywhere, from the hut to the
palace.</p>
<p>The Carnatic war was at this time an impediment, by keeping 
<!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
53</span>the minds of all the natives in a state of excitement 
and anxiety, from dread of Mahratta incursions; but Schwartz 
never intermitted his rounds, and was well supported by the 
Danish Governor, a good man, who often showed himself his 
friend.&nbsp; Some of the missionaries were actually made 
prisoners when the French took Cuddalore, but Count Lally 
Tollendal was very kind to them, and sent them with all their 
property and converts safely away to Tranquebar.</p>
<p>The Dutch missionaries in Ceylon had been in correspondence 
with those of Tranquebar, and had obtained from them copies of 
their Tamul Bible, and in 1760 Schwartz was sent on a visit to 
them.&nbsp; He was very well received by both clergy and laity; 
and though he was laid up by a severe illness at Colombo, yet he 
was exceedingly well contented with his journey and his 
conferences with his brethren.</p>
<p>Christian Schwartz had been more than sixteen years in India, 
and was forty years of age, before his really distinctive and 
independent work began, after his long training in the central 
station at Tranquebar.</p>
<p>The neighbouring district of Tanjore had at different times 
been visited, and the ministers of the Rajah had shown themselves
willing to bestow some reflection on what they heard from the 
missionaries.&nbsp; Visits to this place and to Trichinopoly 
became frequent with him, and in 1766 the Society for Promoting 
Christian Knowledge having decided on planting a mission station 
in the latter place, he was appointed to take the charge of 
it.</p>
<p>About this time he seems to have accommodated his name to 
English pronunciation, and to have always written it 
Swartz.&nbsp; It was now that he became acquainted with William 
Chambers, Esq., brother to the Chief Justice of Bengal,&mdash;not
a Company&rsquo;s servant, but a merchant, and an excellent man, 
who took great interest in missionary labours, and himself 
translated a great part of St. Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel into 
Persian, the court language of India.&nbsp; From a letter of this
gentleman, we obtain the only description we possess of 
Swartz&rsquo;s appearance and manners.&nbsp; He says that, from 
the descriptions he had heard, he had expected to see a very 
austere and strict person, but &ldquo;the first sight of him made
a complete revolution on this point.&nbsp; His garb, indeed, 
which was pretty well worn, seemed foreign and old-fashioned, but
in every other respect his appearance <!-- page 54--><a 
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>was the 
reverse of all that could be called forbidding or morose.&nbsp; 
Figure to yourself a stout well-made man, somewhat above the 
middle size, erect in his carriage and address, with a complexion
rather dark though healthy, black curled hair, and a manly 
engaging countenance, expressive of unaffected candour, 
ingenuousness, and benevolence, and you will have an idea of what
Mr. Swartz appeared to be at first sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. 
Chambers adds that Swartz&rsquo;s whole allowance at Trichinopoly
was ten pagodas a year, that is, about 48<i>l.</i> (as Mr. 
Chambers estimates it).&nbsp; The commanding officer of the 
English garrison was ordered to supply him with quarters, and 
gave him a room in an old native building, where &ldquo;there was
just room for his bed and himself, and in which few men could 
stand upright.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this lodging he was 
content.&nbsp; His food was rice and vegetables dressed native 
fashion, and his clothes were made of black dimity.&nbsp; The 
little brass lamp which he had used for his studies at the 
University went with him to India, and served him all his life, 
often late at night, for he never preached even to the natives 
without much study.</p>
<p>He found the English without church or chaplain, and had very 
little knowledge of their language, having lived almost entirely 
among Germans, Danes, and natives; but he quickly picked it up 
among the soldiers, to whom his kindly simple manners commended 
him; and, as soon as he could speak it to any degree, he began to
read the Church Service every Sunday to the garrison, with a 
printed sermon from an English divine, until he had obtained 
sufficient fluency to preach extempore.&nbsp; At first, the place
of meeting was a large room in an old building, but he afterwards
persuaded them to build themselves a church capable of holding 
from 1,500 to 2,000.&nbsp; His facility in learning languages 
must have been great, for the English of his letters is 
excellent, unless his biographer, Dean Pearson, has altered 
it.&nbsp; It is not at all like that of a German.&nbsp; His 
influence with the soldiers was considered as something 
wonderful, in those times of neglect and immorality, and the 
commandant and his wife&mdash;Colonel and Mrs. Wood&mdash;were 
his warmest friends; and when the Government at Madras heard of 
his voluntary services as chaplain, they granted him, 
unsolicited, a salary of 100<i>l.</i> a year, of which he devoted
half to the service of his congregation.&nbsp; He was thus able 
to build a mission-house, and an English and a Tamul school, 
labour and materials being alike <!-- page 55--><a 
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>cheap.&nbsp; 
But, in spite of all his care of the English soldiery, the 
natives were his chief thought; and he was continually among 
them, reading and arguing home with the most thorough knowledge 
and experience of their difficulties.&nbsp; He made expeditions 
from Trichinopoly to Tanjore, then under the government of a 
Rajah, under the protection of the British Government.&nbsp; The 
principal worship of the place was directed to an enormous black 
bull, said to be hewn out of a single block of granite, and so 
large that the temple had been built round it.</p>
<p>The Brahmins conversed with him a good deal, and often were 
all <i>but</i> converted.&nbsp; One plainly said that love of 
money and pleasure alone kept them from accepting 
Christianity.&nbsp; In 1769 he had a personal interview with the 
Rajah Tuljajee, a man of the dignity, grace, and courtesy usual 
in Hindoo princes, but very indolent, not even rising in the 
morning if he was told that it was not an auspicious day, though 
he was more cultivated than most men of his rank and period.</p>
<p>Swartz found him seated on a couch suspended from pillars, and
was placed opposite to him, on a seat.&nbsp; The interpreter 
addressed him in Persian, and Swartz replied in the same; but, 
perceiving that the man omitted part of his speech, he asked 
leave to speak Tamul.</p>
<p>The Rajah asked questions, which led to an exposition of the 
Christian doctrine, and he listened with interest; and he 
likewise was struck when Swartz uttered a thanksgiving before 
partaking of the sweets that were carried round on trays.&nbsp; 
He showed himself so much disappointed when he learnt that the 
Padre had left Tanjore, that it was resolved that Swartz should 
return thither again; and for some days there were out-of-door 
preachings on the glacis of the fort, where, in spite of clouds 
of dust brought by the land wind, the people collected in crowds 
to hear him, and expressed ardent wishes that the Rajah would 
become a Christian, when they all could do the same.&nbsp; The 
Prince himself was much drawn towards the missionary; but it was 
the old story,&mdash;he was surrounded with ministers and 
courtiers who feared any change, above all any plain-speaking 
truth, and therefore did their best to keep the new light at a 
distance.&nbsp; However, Tuljajee called Swartz &ldquo;<i>his 
padre</i>,&rdquo; and gave him free entrance to his fort at 
Tanjore, where his arguments made a wide impression, and still 
more his example.&nbsp; <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; said a young 
Nabob, &ldquo;we always regarded you Europeans as ungodly men, 
who knew not the use of prayers, till you came among 
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued to go backwards and forwards between Trichinopoly
and Tanjore, in both which places he began to gather catechumens 
round him.&nbsp; Unfortunately his Protestant principles brought 
him into collision with the Roman Catholics at the former 
place.&nbsp; A young Hindoo, of good birth, seems to have had one
of those remarkable natures that cannot rest without truth.&nbsp;
He had for seven years wandered to all the most famous pagodas 
and most sacred rivers, seeking rest for his soul, but in 
vain.&nbsp; Some Roman Catholics had given him a little brass 
crucifix, which he used to set up before him as he prayed; but he
had learnt little more of them, and he was mournfully gazing at 
&ldquo;the pagodas of Sirengam&rdquo; (in his own words), and 
thinking, &ldquo;What is all this? what can it avail?&rdquo; when
some of Swartz&rsquo;s catechists began to speak.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Will this be better than what I have found?&rdquo; he said
to himself.&nbsp; He listened, was asked to remain a fortnight at
the station, and soon had given his whole soul to the 
faith.&nbsp; He was baptized by the name of Ny&aacute;na 
Pr&aacute;casam, or Spiritual Light, and became a 
catechist.&nbsp; His father and mother were likewise led to 
Christianity by him, but the Roman Catholics, having begun his 
conversion, considered that they had a right to him, and on one 
occasion, when he was found reading to a sick relative, probably 
a member of their Church, he was severely beaten, and was rescued
by the heathen neighbours when nearly killed.</p>
<p>Swartz seems to have regarded the Roman Catholics as in almost
as much need of reconversion as the Hindoos and Mahometans; and 
as in those days their Church shared in that universal religious 
torpor that had crept over the world, it is most likely that he 
found them in a very debased condition.</p>
<p>With the Mahometans he had some success, though he found, like
all other missionaries, that their faith, being rather a heresy 
than a paganism, had truth enough in it to be much harder to deal
with than the Hindoo polytheism.&nbsp; Besides, they accepted the
Persian proverb, &ldquo;Every time a man argues, he loses a drop 
of blood from his liver.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was impeded also by the 
want of a Persian translation of the <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>entire Bible,
having no more than the Gospels to give the inquirers, and these 
badly translated; and with Mahometans the want of the real 
history of the Patriarchs was very serious.&nbsp; Some, however, 
were convinced and baptized, though by far the greater number of 
his converts were Hindoos.</p>
<p>In 1776, a coadjutor, either German or Danish-trained, named 
Christian Pohl&eacute;, joined him at Trichinopoly, and thus he 
became free to reside more constantly at Tanjore, where the Rajah
always protected him, though continually fluctuating in feeling 
towards Christianity, according to the influences of his 
ministers and the Brahmins who surrounded him, and the too 
frequent offences given by the godless officers of the European 
garrison which was stationed in the fort.</p>
<p>Mr. Swartz was anxiously soliciting for means to build a 
church for the use of this garrison, when he was summoned to 
Madras, to the governor, Sir Thomas Rumbold, who promised him a 
grant for his church; but, at the same time, informed him that he
was to be sent on a mission to visit the formidable Hyder Ali in 
Mysore, in order to judge how far his intentions towards the 
English were pacific.&nbsp; He was selected for the purpose on 
account of his perfect knowledge of Hindostanee, the simplicity 
of his manner of travelling, and his perfect immunity from any of
the ordinary influences of interest or ambition; and he undertook
it, as he tells the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 
because he regarded it as conducing to peace, as opening fresh 
doors to the Gospel, and as a token of gratitude to the 
Honourable Company for kindness he had received; &ldquo;but at 
the same time,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I resolved to keep my hands
undefiled from any presents, by which determination the Lord 
enabled me to abide, so that I have not accepted a single 
farthing save my travelling expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 1st of July, 1779, he set out from Trichinopoly on this
journey, taking one of his catechists, named Sattianadem, with 
him.&nbsp; He travelled in a palanquin, and took six days to 
reach Caroor, on the Mysore frontier, forty miles off, where he 
stayed a month with a young Ceylonese Dutchman in Hyder 
Ali&rsquo;s service, while sending to ask the Nabob&rsquo;s 
permission to proceed.&nbsp; All this time he and his catechist 
preached and gave instruction in the streets.&nbsp; It is curious
to find him, on his journey, contrasting the excellent state of 
Hyder Ali&rsquo;s roads <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>and bridges with the careless 
disorganization of the public works under the Company.&nbsp; An 
epidemic fever was raging in Seringapatam, and Swartz pitched his
tent outside, where he could conveniently visit the many-pillared
palace of the sovereign.&nbsp; He was much struck with the close 
personal supervision that Hyder Ali kept up over his officers, 
and with the terrible severity of the punishments.&nbsp; Two 
hundred men were kept armed with whips, and not a day passed 
without many being scourged, no rank being exempt, the 
Nabob&rsquo;s two sons and sons-in-law being liable to be whipped
like the meanest groom.&nbsp; Swartz was the unwilling spectator 
of the punishment of the collector of a district who was flogged 
with whips armed with nails.</p>
<p>A few hundreds of Europeans, English, German, and French, were
in Hyder&rsquo;s pay, encamped about the town, and a German 
captain lent his tent for public worship.&nbsp; No molestation 
was offered to any instructions that Swartz attempted to give, 
and he was very courteously entreated by the Prince 
himself.&nbsp; The conferences with him were generally held in a 
hall of marble columns, open to a garden adorned with fruit 
trees, rows of cypresses, and fountains.&nbsp; Hyder Ali sat on 
rich carpets, covering the floor, and the Padre was placed next 
to him.&nbsp; He spoke in general terms of his desire to keep the
peace, though the British had violated their engagements, 
referring to an attempt that had newly been made to march troops 
through his territory without his permission.&nbsp; To Swartz he 
was gracious in speech, but the letter he entrusted to him was 
full of threatening for this and other acts which he considered 
aggressive; and the general impression brought back by the 
missionary was that a war was to be expected.</p>
<p>Hyder Ali had presented him with a bag of three hundred rupees
for travelling expenses, which it would have been a great affront
to return.&nbsp; He, however, made it over to the Government at 
Madras, and when they would not take it, asked leave to use it as
the foundation for a collection for an English orphan school at 
Tanjore.&nbsp; This was granted, and proved a success.&nbsp; 
Finding that there was an intention of voting a present to him, 
he begged instead that a salary might be given to Mr. 
Pohl&eacute; at Trichinopoly; and, in consequence, both were 
enabled to maintain catechists and schoolmasters; for of making a
home for themselves, these devoted men never thought.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>Moreover, Swartz obtained bricks and lime for the 
building of his English church within the fort; and he bought and
enlarged a house half a mile from it, for his Malabar Christians 
to worship in.&nbsp; His own observations of Hyder Ali&rsquo;s 
warlike intentions led also to his purchasing 12,000 bags of rice
as a provision against the scarcity that too surely attends upon 
Indian warfare.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1780, these apprehensions were 
realized.&nbsp; Hyder crossed the Ghauts, and passed down into 
the Carnatic with 100,000 men, directed by a staff of French 
officers, and plundered up to the very gates of Madras.&nbsp; 
Everything was in the greatest confusion; the English troops were
dispersed in garrisons, and could not easily be brought together;
and one small detachment under Colonel Baillie, who were made 
prisoners at Conjiveram, suffered a frightful captivity.&nbsp; 
Sir Eyre Coote did, indeed, keep the enemy in check, and defeat 
him in several battles, but had not at first sufficient numbers 
or stores effectually to drive him back; and the whole province 
of Tanjore was horribly wasted.&nbsp; The irrigation of the 
district had been broken up by the invaders; there was for three 
years neither seed-time nor harvest, and the miserable peasants 
crawled into the towns to perish there, often with their sons 
carried off to form a regiment of youths whom Hyder Ali was 
bringing up as a sort of Janissaries.</p>
<p>The unhappy creatures lay dying along the sides of the road, 
and among them moved from one to another that homely figure in 
the black dimity dress, and his catechists with him, feeding 
those who could still swallow, and speaking words of comfort to 
those who could hear.&nbsp; Some of the English sent a monthly 
subscription, which enabled Swartz to keep up the supply, so that
a hundred and twenty a day were fed; but often in the morning he 
found the dead lying in heaps, and in one of his letters he 
mentions that his catechists are alive, as though he regarded it 
as a wonder and a mercy.&nbsp; Indeed he seems to have been a 
very Joseph to the Rajah, and even to the English garrison.&nbsp;
There was absolutely no magazine for provisions, either for the 
Sepoys or the Rajah&rsquo;s own troops, and twice he was 
implored, both by Tuljajee and the Company, to purchase supplies 
and get them brought in, since they were unable to do so, 
&ldquo;for a want of good understanding with the natives who 
still possessed either rice or <!-- page 60--><a 
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>oxen to 
transport it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was enabled to procure the supply, 
and then there was no place to store it in but his own new 
English church, so that he was obliged to hold three services on 
a Sunday in the other: from eight till ten in English, from ten 
till twelve in Tamul, and from four till five in 
Portuguese!&nbsp; About a hundred converts were gained during the
famine; but he was forced to teach them very slowly, their mental
faculties were so weakened by their state of exhaustion.&nbsp; 
The whole of the towns of Tanjore and Trichinopoly were, he says,
filled with living skeletons, there was hardly an able or 
vigorous man to be found, and in this distress it was necessary 
to relax the ordinarily wise rule of never giving any assistance 
to a person under preparation for baptism, since to withhold 
succour would have been barbarous cruelty.</p>
<p>When the whole country was overrun by the troops of Mysore, 
the respect paid to the good Padre was such that he travelled 
from end to end of it without hindrance, even through the midst 
of the enemy&rsquo;s camp, and on the only occasion when he was 
detained, the sentinel politely put it that &ldquo;he was waiting
for orders to let him proceed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was on one of 
these journeys that a little lad, named Christian David, the son 
of one of the converts, was attending him one evening, when, 
halting at a native village, the supper was brought, of rice and 
curry.&nbsp; The Padre made so long a grace out of the fulness of
his heart, that at last the boy broke in with a murmur that the 
curry would be cold!&nbsp; He never forgot the reproof: 
&ldquo;What! shall our gracious God watch over us through the 
heat and burden of the day, and shall we devour the food which He
provides for us at night, with hands which we have never raised 
in prayer, and lips which have never praised Him?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The missionaries were always safe throughout the war, and, when 
Cuddalore capitulated to the French and Mysoreans, Mr. 
Gerick&eacute;, who was then at the head of the station, 
concealed some English officers in his house, and likewise, by 
his representations to the French general, saved the town from 
being delivered up to be plundered by Hyder&rsquo;s native 
troops.</p>
<p>In the end of 1782, Hyder Ali died; his son, Tippoo Sahib, 
assuming the title of Sultan, continued the war, with the same 
fierceness, but without the assistance of the French, who were 
withdrawn, in consequence of the peace that had been concluded at
home.</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>This, together with the numerous victories that had been
obtained by the English forces, led to hopes that Tippoo would 
consent to terms of peace, and two Commissioners were appointed, 
whom Swartz was requested to join as interpreter.&nbsp; He had no
taste for political missions, but he thought it a duty to do all 
in his power for peace, and set off for the purpose, but the 
Mysoreans complained that the English promises had not been kept,
and he was turned back again by the enemy&rsquo;s troops.&nbsp; 
Colonel Fullarton, who was in command of the army about to invade
Mysore, writes, &ldquo;The knowledge and the integrity of this 
irreproachable missionary have retrieved the character of 
Europeans from <i>imputations of general 
depravity</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; He went back to Tanjore, and there, 
for the first time, experienced some failure in health.&nbsp; He 
was requested again to join the Commissioners, but would not 
again attempt it, partly from the state of his health, and partly
because Tippoo was far more averse to Christianity than Hyder had
been.&nbsp; All the 12,000 Tanjoreen captive 
boys&mdash;originally Hindoos&mdash;were bred up Mahometans, and 
he tolerated nothing else but Hindooism, persecuting the Roman 
Catholics in his dominions till no one dared make an open 
profession.</p>
<p>A treaty was, however, concluded in 1784, and there was for a 
time a little rest, greatly needed by Swartz, who had been 
suffering from much weakness and exhaustion; but a journey into 
Tinnevelly, with his friend Mr. Sullivan, seems to have restored 
him.</p>
<p>There were already some dawnings of Christianity in this 
district.&nbsp; As long before as 1771, one of the Trichinopoly 
converts, named Schavrimutta, who was living at Palamcotta, began
to instruct his neighbours from the Bible, and a young Hindoo 
accountant, becoming interested, went to an English sergeant and 
his wife, who had likewise been under Swartz&rsquo;s influence, 
and asked for further teaching.&nbsp; The sergeant taught him the
Catechism and then baptized him, rather to the displeasure of 
Swartz, who always was strongly averse to hasty baptisms.&nbsp; 
Afterwards, a Brahmin&rsquo;s widow begged for baptism.&nbsp; 
She, it appeared, was living with an English officer, and Swartz 
was obliged to refuse her while this state of things continued, 
but he found that the Englishman had promised to marry her, and 
had begun to teach her his language and his faith.&nbsp; He died 
without performing his promise, but Christianity had <!-- page 
62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>become so dear to her, that she again entreated for 
baptism, and was then admitted into the Church by the name of 
Clarinda.&nbsp; She afterwards was the chief means of building a 
church at Palamcotta, to which Sattianadem became the catechist; 
and thus was first sown a seed which has never ceased growing, 
for this district of Tinnevelly has always been the stronghold of
Christianity in India.</p>
<p>Meantime Swartz&rsquo;s poor friend, the Rajah Tuljajee at 
Tanjore, was in a deplorable state.&nbsp; He had suffered great 
losses during Hyder Ali&rsquo;s invasion of his country, and, 
moreover, was afflicted with an incurable disease, and had lately
lost, by death, his only son, daughter, and grandson: He shut 
himself up in the depths of his palace, and became harsh and 
moody, heaping all the treasure together that he could collect, 
and employing a dean or minister, named Baba, whose exactions on 
the famished population were so intolerable that the people fled 
the country, and settled in the neighbouring districts, so that 
no less than 65,000 were said to have deserted the province.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald Campbell, Governor of Madras, remonstrated, but 
the Rajah was affronted, and would not dismiss his minister, and 
as the peasants refused to sow their land without some security 
that the crops should not be reaped by Baba&rsquo;s emissaries 
before their very eyes, the Madras authorities decided on taking 
the management of Tanjoreen affairs into their hands and 
appointing a committee to watch over the government.&nbsp; Sir 
Archibald wished to place Mr. Swartz on this committee as the 
person best able to deal both with Rajah and people, and he 
accepted a seat, only stipulating that he was not to share in any
violent or coercive measures.</p>
<p>When the &ldquo;good Padre&rdquo; assured the fugitives in the
Rajah&rsquo;s name and his own that oppression was at an end, 
7,000 at once returned; and when he reminded them that the season
for planting their corps was nearly past, they replied that in 
return for his kindness they intended to work night and day.</p>
<p>In 1787, the childless Rajah decided on&mdash;after the 
fashion of many Hindoo princes&mdash;adopting an heir, who might 
perform the last duties which were incumbent on a son.&nbsp; His 
choice fell upon the son of a near kinsman, a child ten years of 
age, whom he named Serfojee.&nbsp; A day or two after he sent for
Mr. Swartz, and said, &ldquo;This is not my son, but yours.&nbsp;
Into your hand I deliver him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;May the child 
become a child of <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>God,&rdquo; was the answer of 
Swartz.&nbsp; The Rajah was too ill to continue the interview, 
but he sent for Swartz the next day, and said, &ldquo;I appoint 
you guardian to this child; I put his hands into 
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swartz, however, did not think it right to undertake the state
guardianship of the lad, and the administration of the 
province.&nbsp; Indeed, he knew that to do so would be absolutely
to put the child&rsquo;s life in danger, from the cabals and 
jealousies which would be excited, and he induced Tuljajee to 
confide the charge to his brother, Rama Swamey, afterwards called
Ameer Singh.</p>
<p>This was done, and the Rajah soon after died, in the year 
1787, leaving the boy and Ameer Singh under the protection of the
Company.&nbsp; He had always listened to Swartz willingly, and 
treated him affectionately, and the result of the influence of 
the missionary extended so far that no Suttee took place at his 
funeral, but he had never actually embraced Christianity, though 
protecting it to the utmost of his power.</p>
<p>The brother, Ameer Singh, was not contented merely to act as 
regent, but complained that injustice was done to him, and that 
Tuljajee was too much enfeebled in mind to judge of his own 
measures when he adopted the boy Serfojee.&nbsp; Sir Archibald 
Campbell, acting for the Company, came to Tanjore, and, after an 
examination into the circumstances, decided in favour of Ameer 
Singh, and confirmed him in the Rajahship, binding him over to be
the faithful protector of poor little Serfojee, who, putting the 
adoption apart, was still his near relation.</p>
<p>Ameer was not a better manager of his province than his 
brother had been, and he was far from kind to Serfojee, whom 
Swartz had not been allowed to see for months, when the widows of
the late Rajah made complaints that the boy was closely shut up 
and cruelly treated.&nbsp; On this Swartz applied to Government, 
and obtained an order to go with another gentleman to inquire 
into his condition.&nbsp; The Rajah was much offended; but as he 
reigned only by the protection of the English, he could not 
refuse, and the Padre was conducted to a large but dark room, 
where he found the poor child sitting by lamp-light.&nbsp; This 
had been his condition for almost two years, ever since his 
adopted father&rsquo;s death, and on seeing the Padre, he asked 
piteously if it were the way in Europe to prevent children from 
seeing the sun and moon.&nbsp; Mr. Swartz comforted him, <!-- 
page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
64</span>and asked him if he had any one to teach him.&nbsp; The 
Rajah&rsquo;s minister replied that he had a master, but was too 
idle to learn; but Serfojee looked up and said, &ldquo;I have 
none to teach me, therefore I do not know a single 
letter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rajah was only offended at remonstrance,
and at last Government sent orders that could not be resisted, 
and a Sepoy guard to take charge of the lad.&nbsp; Then, as a 
great favour, the Rajah entreated that the guard would not enter 
his palace, but that for the night before Serfojee could be 
removed, the Padre would remain with him to satisfy them that he 
was safe.&nbsp; To this Swartz consented, and the guard 
disappeared, whereupon the Rajah told him &ldquo;he might go 
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! and be guilty of a breach of faith?&rdquo; was 
his resolute answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even my father should not be 
permitted to make me such a proposal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were ashamed, and left him to remain that night with 
Serfojee, whom he probably thus saved from foul play, since the 
jealous and vindictive passions of Ameer Singh had been 
thoroughly excited.&nbsp; The captivity must have been very 
wretched, for he observed that the poor boy walked lame, and 
found that the cause was this:&mdash;&ldquo;I have not been able 
to sleep,&rdquo; said poor Serfojee, &ldquo;from the number of 
insects in my room, but have had to sit clasping my knees about 
with my arms.&nbsp; My sinews are a little contracted, but I hope
I shall soon recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When taken out, the poor little fellow was delighted once more
to see the sun, and to ride out again.&nbsp; A Brahmin master 
selected by Mr. Swartz was given to him, and he very rapidly 
learnt both to read his own language and English.&nbsp; Swartz 
also interfered on behalf of the late Rajah&rsquo;s minister, 
Baba, who had indeed been extortionate and severe, but scarcely 
deserved such a punishment as being put into a hole six feet long
and four feet broad and high.</p>
<p>For two years Serfojee was unmolested; but, in 1792, the 
husband of Ameer Singh&rsquo;s only child died without children, 
and this misfortune was attributed by the Rajah to witchcraft on 
the part of the widows of Tuljajee.&nbsp; He imagined that they 
were contriving against his own life, and included Serfojee in 
his hatred.&nbsp; By way of revenge, he caused a pile of chilis 
and other noxious plants to be burnt under Serfojee&rsquo;s 
windows, and thus nearly stifled him and his attendants.&nbsp; He
prevented the <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Prince&rsquo;s teachers from having 
access to him, shut up his servants, and denied permission to 
merchants to bring their wares to him.&nbsp; Mr. Swartz was 
absent at the time, and Serfojee wrote a letter to him, begging 
that the English Government would again interfere.&nbsp; It was 
found that any remonstrance put the Rajah into such a state of 
fury that the lives of the youth and the ladies we&rsquo;re 
really unsafe while they remained within his reach, and it was 
therefore decided that they should be transplanted to 
Madras.&nbsp; It was a wonderful step for Hindoo princesses to 
take, and was only accomplished by the influence of Mr. Swartz, 
backed by a guard of soldiers, under whose escort all safely 
arrived at Madras, where Serfojee&rsquo;s education could at 
length be properly carried on.</p>
<p>The youth was so entirely the child of Swartz and of the 
Government, that it is disappointing to find that he did not 
become a Christian.&nbsp; No stipulation to the contrary seems to
have been made by Tuljajee; but, probably, the missionary 
refrained from a sense of honour towards the late Rajah, and 
because to bring the boy up in the Church would have destroyed 
all chance of his obtaining the provinces, and probably have 
deprived him of the protection of the Company, who dreaded the 
suspicion of proselytizing.&nbsp; Still it is very disappointing,
and requires all our trust in Swartz&rsquo;s judgment and 
excellence to be satisfied that he was right in leaving this 
child, who had been confided to him, all his life a 
heathen.&nbsp; Serfojee learnt the theory of Christianity, was 
deeply attached to Mr. Swartz, and lived a life very superior to 
that of most Hindoo princes of his time.&nbsp; His faith in his 
hereditary paganism was probably only political, but he never 
made the desperate, and no doubt perilous, plunge of giving up 
all the world to save his own soul.&nbsp; Was it his fault, or 
was it any shortcoming in the teaching that was laid before him, 
and was that human honour a want of faith?&nbsp; It puzzles 
us!&nbsp; Here was Swartz, from early youth to hoary hairs 
unwavering in the work of the Gospel, gathering in multitudes to 
the Church, often at great peril to himself, yet holding back 
from bringing into the fold the child who had been committed to 
him, and, as far as we can see, without any stipulation to the 
contrary.&nbsp; Probably he thought it right to leave 
Serfojee&rsquo;s decision uninfluenced until his education should
be complete, and was disappointed that the force of old custom 
and the danger <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>of change were then too strong for 
him; and thus it was that Serfojee was only one of the many 
half-reclaimed Indian princes who have lived out their dreary, 
useless lives under English protection, without accepting the one
pearl of great price which could alone have made them 
gainers.</p>
<p>It is just possible that there may have been too much of a 
certain sort of acquiescence in Swartz&rsquo;s mind, missionary 
as he was.&nbsp; He did not attack the system of caste, with its 
multitudinous separations and distinctions.&nbsp; Of course he 
wished it to be abolished, but he accepted converts without 
requiring its renunciation, allowed high-caste persons to sit 
apart in the churches, and to communicate before Pariahs, and did
not interfere with their habits of touching no food that the very
finger of a person of a different caste had defiled.&nbsp; He no 
doubt thought these things would wither away of themselves, but 
his having permitted them, left a world of difficulty to his 
successors.</p>
<p>He lived, however, the life of a saint, nearly that of an 
ascetic.&nbsp; His almost unfurnished house was shared with some 
younger missionary.&nbsp; Kohloff, who was one of these, related 
in after years how plain their diet was.&nbsp; Some tea in a jug,
with boiling water poured over it and dry bread broken into it, 
formed the breakfast, which lasted five minutes; dinner, at one, 
was of broth or curry; and at eight at night they had some meal 
or gruel.&nbsp; If wine were sent them, it was reserved for the 
communions or for the sick.&nbsp; Swartz only began, very late in
life, to take a single glass in the middle of his Sunday 
services.</p>
<p>Every morning he assembled his native catechists at early 
prayer, and appointed them their day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You go there.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You do 
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You call on such and such 
families.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You visit such a 
village.&rdquo;&nbsp; About four o&rsquo;clock they returned and 
made their report, when their master took them all with him to 
the churchyard or some public place, or to the front of the 
Mission-house, according to the season of the year, and there sat
either expounding the Scriptures to those who would come and 
listen, or conversing with inquirers and objectors among the 
heathen.&nbsp; His manner was mild, sometimes humorous, but very 
authoritative, and he would brook neither idleness nor 
disobedience.</p>
<p>Over his Christian flock his authority was as complete as <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
67</span>ever that of Samuel could have been as a judge.&nbsp; If
any of them did wrong, the alternative was&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go to the Rajah&rsquo;s court, or be punished 
by me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Padre, you punish me!&rdquo; was always the 
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him twenty strokes,&rdquo; said the Padre, and it 
was done.</p>
<p>The universal confidence in the Padre, felt alike by 
Englishmen and Hindoos, was inestimable in procuring and carrying
out regulations for the temporal prosperity of the peasantry at 
Tanjore, under the Board which had pretty well taken the 
authority out of the hands of the inefficient and violent Ameer 
Singh.&nbsp; Districts that, partly from misery, had become full 
of thieves, were brought into order, and the thieves themselves 
often became hopeful converts, and endured a good deal of 
persecution from their heathen neighbours.&nbsp; His good 
judgment in dealing with all classes, high and low, English or 
native, does indeed seem to have been wonderful, and almost 
always to have prevailed, probably through his perfect honesty, 
simplicity, and disinterestedness.</p>
<p>The converts in Tinnevelly became more and more numerous, and 
Sattianadem had been ordained to the ministry, Lutheran fashion, 
by the assembly of the presbytery at Tranquebar, there being as 
yet no Bishop in India; and thus many, the very best of his 
catechists, served for many years, at Palamcotta, the first 
Christian minister produced by modern India.&nbsp; On the whole, 
Swartz could look back on the half-century of his mission with 
great joy and thankfulness; he counted his spiritual children by 
hundreds; and the influence he had exerted upon the whole 
Government had saved multitudes of peasants from oppression and 
starvation, and had raised the whole tone of the 
administration.&nbsp; He was once or twice unkindly attacked by 
Englishmen who hated or mistrusted the propagation of 
Christianity.&nbsp; One gentleman even wrote a letter in a 
newspaper calling a missionary a disgrace to any nation, and 
raking up stories of the malpractices of heathens who had been 
preached to without being converted, which were laid to the 
charge of the actual Christians; but imputations like these did 
not meet with faith from any one whose good opinion was of any 
real consequence to Swartz.</p>
<p>His strong health and the suitability of his constitution to 
the climate brought him to a good old age in full activity.&nbsp;
He had become the patriarch of the community of missionaries, 
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>and had survived all those with whom he had at first 
laboured; but he was still able to circulate among the churches 
he had founded, teaching, praying, preaching and counselling, or 
laying any difficulty before the Government, whose attention he 
had so well earned.&nbsp; His last care was establishing the 
validity of the adoption of Serfojee, who had grown up a 
thoughtful, gentle, and upright man, satisfactory on all points 
except on the one which rendered him eligible to the throne of 
Tanjore, his continued heathenism.&nbsp; The question was 
referred to the Company at home, and before the answer could 
arrive, by the slow communication of those days, when the long 
voyage, and that by a sailing vessel, was the only mode of 
conveyance, the venerable guardian of the young Rajah had sunk 
into his last illness.</p>
<p>This was connected with a mortification in his left foot, 
which had been more or less painful for several years, but had 
probably been neglected.&nbsp; His Danish colleague, Mr. 
Gerick&eacute;, was with him most of the time, and it was one of 
his subjects of thankfulness that he was permitted to depart out 
of the world in the society of faithful brethren.&nbsp; He 
suffered severely for about three months, but it was not till the
last week that his departure was thought to be near.&nbsp; He 
liked to have the English children brought in to read to him 
chapters of the Bible and sing Dr. Watts&rsquo;s hymns to him; 
and the beautiful old German hymns sung by Mr. Gerick&eacute; and
Mr. Kohloff were his great delight.&nbsp; Indeed, when at the 
very last, as he lay almost lifeless, with closed eyes, Mr. 
Gerick&eacute; began to sing the hymn,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Only to Thee, Lord <span 
class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he joined in with a clear melodious voice, and accompanied him
to the end.&nbsp; Two hours later, about four o&rsquo;clock in 
the afternoon of the 13th of February, 1798, Christian Friedrich 
Swartz breathed his last, in the seventy-second year of his age, 
and the forty-eighth of his mission service in India.</p>
<p>The cries and wailings of the poor resounded all night around 
the house, and Serfojee Rajah came from a distance to be present 
at his burial.&nbsp; It had been intended to sing a funeral hymn,
but the cries and lamentations of the poor so overcame the 
clergy, that they could scarcely raise their voices.&nbsp; 
Serfojee wept bitterly, laid a gold cloth over the bier, and 
remained present while Mr. Gerick&eacute; read the Funeral 
Service,&mdash;a most <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>unusual departure from Hindoo custom,
and a great testimony of affection and respect.</p>
<p>A few months later arrived the decision of the East India 
Company, that the weak and rapacious Ameer Singh should be 
deposed, and Serfojee placed on the throne.&nbsp; He conducted 
himself excellently as a ruler, and greatly favoured Christians 
in his territory, always assisting the various schools, and 
giving liberal aid whenever the frequently-recurring famines of 
India brought them into distress.</p>
<p>Three years later, in 1801, Serfojee wrote to the Society for 
Promoting Christian Knowledge, to beg them to order a 
&ldquo;monument of marble&rdquo; at his expense, to the memory of
the late Rev. Father Swartz, to be affixed to the pillar nearest 
the pulpit.&nbsp; Accordingly, a bas-relief in white marble was 
executed by Flaxman, representing the death of Swartz, 
Gerick&eacute; behind him, two native Christians and three 
children standing by, and Serfojee clasping his hand and 
receiving his blessing.&nbsp; It was not exactly fact, but it was
the monumental taste of the day; and it so much delighted the 
Rajah, that he kept it in his palace, among the portraits of his 
ancestors, for two years before he could resolve on parting with 
it to the church.&nbsp; The Prince likewise composed the epitaph 
which was carved on the stone which covers the grave of Swartz, 
the first instance of English verse by a Hindoo:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Firm wast thou, humble and wise,<br />
Honest, pure, free from disguise;<br />
Father of orphans, the widow&rsquo;s support,<br />
Comfort in sorrow of every sort:<br />
To the benighted dispenser of light,<br />
Doing and pointing to that which is right.<br />
Blessing to princes, to people, to me,<br />
May I, my father, be worthy of thee,<br />
Wisheth and prayeth thy Sarabojee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Swartz had always been striving to be poor, and never 
succeeding.&nbsp; Living and eating in the humblest manner, and 
giving away all that came to him, still recognitions of services 
from English and natives had flowed in on him; and, after all the
hosts of poor he had fed, and of churches and schools he had 
founded, he was an instance of &ldquo;there is that scattereth 
and yet increaseth;&rdquo; for the property he bequeathed to the 
Mission was enough to assist materially in carrying it on after 
<!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>his death.&nbsp; Moreover, Serfojee maintained the 
blind, lame, and decrepit members of his church, and founded an 
asylum for the orphan children; so that the good men, 
Gerick&eacute;, Kohloff, Pohl&eacute;, and the rest, were not 
absolutely dependent on Europe for assistance; and this was well,
since the Orphan-house at Halle and the Society at Copenhagen had
in this long course of years ceased to send out funds.</p>
<p>But Swartz&rsquo;s work under their hands continued to 
prosper.&nbsp; He had a sort of apotheosis among the heathen, 
such as he would have been the last to covet; for statues were 
raised to him, lights burnt before him, and crowns offered 
up.&nbsp; But about Palamcotta and throughout Tinnevelly there 
was one of those sudden movements towards Christianity that 
sometimes takes place.&nbsp; The natives were asking instruction 
from their friends, and going eagerly in search of the catechists
and of Sattianadem, and even burning their idols and building 
chapels in preparation for the coming of more fully qualified 
teachers.&nbsp; Mr. Gerick&eacute; made a tour among them in 
1803, and found their hearts so moved towards the Gospel, that he
baptized 1,300 in the course of his journey, and the work of 
Sattianadem and the catechists raised the number of converts to 
4,000.&nbsp; This was, however, this good man&rsquo;s last 
journey.&nbsp; On his return, he found that his only son, an 
officer in the Company&rsquo;s service, was dying, and, under the
weight of this and other troubles, his health gave way, and he 
died in the thirty-eighth year of his mission.&nbsp; Others of 
the original Danish and German missionaries likewise died, and 
scarcely any came out in their stead.&nbsp; Their places were, 
therefore, supplied by ordinations, by the assembly of ministers,
of four native catechists, of whom was Nyanapracasem, a favourite
pupil of Swartz.&nbsp; No Church can take root without a native 
ministry.&nbsp; But the absence of any central Church government 
was grievously felt, both as concerned the English and the 
Hindoos.&nbsp; There were more than twenty English regiments in 
India, and not a single chaplain among them all.</p>
<h2><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; HENRY MARTYN, THE 
SCHOLAR-MISSIONARY.</h2>
<p>Again do we find the steady, plodding labourer of a lifetime 
contrasted with the warm enthusiast, whose lot seems rather to 
awaken others than to achieve victories in his own person.&nbsp; 
St. Stephen falls beneath the stones, but his glowing discourse 
is traced through many a deep argument of St. Paul.&nbsp; St. 
James drains the cup in early manhood, but his brother holds 
aloft his witness to extreme old age.</p>
<p>The ardent zeal of the Keltic character; the religious 
atmosphere that John Wesley had spread over Cornwall, even among 
those who did not enrol themselves among his followers; the 
ability and sensitiveness hereditary in the Martyn family, 
together with the strong influence of a university 
tutor,&mdash;all combined to make such a bright and brief trail 
of light of the career of Henry Martyn, the son of the head clerk
in a merchant&rsquo;s office at Truro, born on the 18th of 
February, 1781.&nbsp; This station sounds lowly enough, but when 
we find that it was attained by a self-educated man, who had 
begun life as a common miner, and taught himself in the intervals
of rest, it is plain that the elder Martyn must have possessed no
ordinary power.&nbsp; Out of a numerous family only four survived
their infancy, and only one reached middle age, and in Henry at 
least great talent was united to an extreme susceptibility and 
delicacy of frame, which made him as a child unusually tender and
gentle in manner when at his ease, but fretful and passionate 
when annoyed.</p>
<p>Of course he fared as ill with his fellow-scholars at Truro 
Grammar School as he did well with the masters; but an elder boy 
took him under his protection, and not only lessened his 
grievances at the time, but founded a lasting friendship.</p>
<p>In 1795, when only fourteen, Henry Martyn was sufficiently 
advanced to be sent up as a candidate for a scholarship at Corpus
Christi College, Oxford, and passed a very creditable 
examination, though he failed in obtaining the election.&nbsp; 
Eight years later, we find him congratulating himself in his 
journal on thus having <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>escaped the &ldquo;scenes of 
debauchery&rdquo; to which his &ldquo;profligate 
acquaintances&rdquo; might have introduced him.&nbsp; Was Corpus 
very much changed, when, only eleven years after, John Keble 
entered it at the same age?&nbsp; Was it that Martyn&rsquo;s 
Cornish schoolfellows were a bad set, or does this thanksgiving 
proceed from the sort of pious complacency which religious 
journalizing is apt to produce in the best of men?</p>
<p>The failure sent Henry back to work for two years longer at 
the Truro Grammar School, and when at sixteen he was entered at 
St. John&rsquo;s, Cambridge (most peculiarly the college of 
future missionaries), he immediately made proof of his remarkable
talent.&nbsp; Strange to say, although his father&rsquo;s rise in
life had begun in his mathematical ability, Henry&rsquo;s 
training in this branch had been so deficient, and the study 
appeared so repugnant to him, that his first endeavour at 
Cambridge was to learn the proportions of Euclid by heart, 
without trying to follow their reasoning.&nbsp; This story is 
told of many persons, but perhaps of no one else who in four 
years&rsquo; time, while still a month under twenty, was declared
Senior Wrangler.</p>
<p>This was in 1801, and the intervening time had been spent in 
hard study and regular habits, but neither his sister at home, 
nor a seriously-minded college friend, were satisfied with his 
religious feelings during the first part of the time, and he 
himself regarded it afterwards as a period of darkness.&nbsp; 
Indeed, his temper was under so little control that in a passion 
he threw a knife at a companion, but happily missed his aim, so 
that it only pierced the wall.&nbsp; The shock of horror no doubt
was good for him.&nbsp; But the next step he recorded in his life
was his <i>surprise</i> at hearing it maintained that the glory 
of God, not the praise of man, should be the chief motive of 
study.&nbsp; After thinking it over his mind assented, and he 
resolved to maintain this as a noble saying, but did not perceive
that it would affect his conduct.</p>
<p>However, the dearest, almost the only hallowed form of the 
praise of man, was taken from him by the death of his father in 
1799, immediately after the delight of hearing of his standing 
first in the Christmas examination.&nbsp; The expense of a return
home was beyond his means, but he took to reading the Bible, as a
proper form to be complied with in the days of mourning; and 
beginning with the Acts, as being the most entertaining part, he 
felt the full weight of the doctrine of the Apostles borne <!-- 
page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>in on him, and was roused to renew his long-neglected 
prayers.&nbsp; When next he went to chapel, with his soul thus 
awakened, he was struck by perceiving for the first time how joy 
for the coming of our Lord rings through the 
<i>Magnificat</i>.</p>
<p>The great religious influence of the day at Cambridge emanated
from the pulpit and the rooms of the Reverend Charles Simeon, who
did a truly remarkable work in stirring up young men to a sense 
of the responsibilities of the ministry.&nbsp; Henry Martyn 
regularly attended his sermons, and the newly lighted sparks were
also fanned by anxious letters from the good sister at home; but 
until the strain, pressure, and excitement of preparing for the 
final examination were over, he had little time or attention for 
any other form of mental exertion.</p>
<p>When, however, he found himself in possession of the highest 
honours his University could award, he was amazed to discover how
little they satisfied him, and that he felt as if he had grasped 
a shadow instead of a substance.</p>
<p>This instinctive longing, the sure token of a mind of the 
higher pitch, was finding rest as he became more and more imbued 
with the spirit of religion, and ventured upon manifesting it 
more openly.&nbsp; He had hitherto intended to apply himself to 
the law, but the example and conversation of Charles Simeon 
brought him to such a perception of the greatness of the office 
of the ministry that he resolved to dedicate himself 
thereto.&nbsp; During the term after this decision was made, 
while he was acting as a tutor at his college, he heard Mr. 
Simeon speak of William Carey and his self-devotion in India; he 
read the Life of that kindred spirit, David Brainerd, and the 
spark of missionary zeal was kindled in his ardent nature.&nbsp; 
The commission &ldquo;Go ye and teach all nations&rdquo; was 
borne in on his mind, and, with the promptness that was a part of
his nature, he at once offered himself to the &ldquo;Society for 
Missions to Africa and the East,&rdquo; which had been 
established, in the year 1800, by members of the English Church 
who wished to act independently of the elder Society for the 
Propagation of the Gospel.&nbsp; The name has since been altered 
to the &ldquo;Church Missionary Society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Martyn was only just twenty-one, and not of an age to
take Holy Orders, and he had therefore to wait, while studying 
divinity, and acting as a tutor at Cambridge.&nbsp; All through 
his life he kept copious journals of his sensations <!-- page 
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and 
resolutions, full of the deepest piety, always replete with 
sternness towards himself and others, and tinged with that 
melancholy which usually pervades the more earnest of that school
which requires conscious feeling as the test of spiritual 
life.</p>
<p>In October 1803, he went to Ely for ordination as a deacon, 
though still wanting five months of twenty-three.&nbsp; Those 
were lax days, there was little examination, and a very low 
standard of fitness was required.&nbsp; Henry Martyn was so much 
scandalized by the lightness of demeanour of one of his fellow 
candidates that he spoke to him in strong reproof&mdash;with what
effect we do not know, but he records that he never ventured to 
speak in rebuke, &ldquo;unless he at the same time experienced a 
peculiar contrition of spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He became Mr. Simeon&rsquo;s curate, and at the same time took
charge of the neighbouring parish of Lolworth.&nbsp; People then 
had small expectations of clerical care, if a parish could be 
entrusted to a young deacon, non-resident, acting as tutor and 
examiner, and with an assistant curacy besides!&nbsp; His whole 
mind was, however, intensely full of his duties, and so unworthy 
did he consider all other occupations that he prayed and 
struggled conscientiously against the pleasure he could not but 
feel, in getting up Thucydides and Xenophon for the 
examinations.&nbsp; Everything not actually devotional seemed to 
him at these times under a ban, and it is painful to see how a 
mind of great scope and power was cramped and contracted, and the
spirits lowered by incessant self-contemplation and distrust of 
almost all enjoyment.&nbsp; When, at another time, he had to 
examine on &ldquo;Locke on the Human Understanding,&rdquo; the 
metaphysical study acting on his already introspective mind 
produced a sense of misery and anguish that he could hardly 
endure.&nbsp; It is pleasant, however, to find him in another 
mood, writing, &ldquo;Since I have known God in a saving manner, 
painting, poetry, and music have had charms unknown to me before;
I have received what I suppose is a taste for them, for religion 
has refined my mind, and made it susceptible of impressions from 
the sublime and beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, no doubt, was true, but another influence had awakened 
his heart, earthly perhaps in itself, but so noble and so holy 
that it bears a heavenly light.&nbsp; He had become attached to a
young lady in Cornwall, named Lydia Grenfell, like-minded <!-- 
page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
75</span>enough to return his affection.&nbsp; His intention of 
volunteering for the Church Missionary Society was overthrown by 
a disaster in Cornwall which deprived himself and his unmarried 
sister of all the provision that their father had made for them, 
thus throwing her upon him for maintenance, and making it 
necessary that he should obtain a salary that would support 
her.&nbsp; It was suggested by some of his friends that one of 
the chaplaincies founded by the old East India Company, before 
the jealousy of religious teaching had set in, would both give 
him opportunities for missionary work and enable him to provide 
for his sister at home.&nbsp; Application was accordingly made, 
and a man of his talent and character could not fail of being 
accepted; he was promised the next vacant post, and went down to 
spend the long vacation in Cornwall, and bid farewell to all whom
he loved there, for the journey was long and expensive, and he 
had resolved not to trust himself among them again.</p>
<p>He writes in his journal, &ldquo;Parted with Lydia for ever in
this life with a sort of uncertain pain, which I knew would 
increase to violence.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it was, he suffered 
most acutely for many days, and, though calmness and comfort came
after a time, never were hopes and affections more thoroughly 
sacrificed, or with more anguish, than by this most truly devoted
disciple of his Master.</p>
<p>He worked on at Cambridge till he received his appointment in 
the January of 1805, and he then only waited to receive 
Priests&rsquo; Orders before going to London to prepare for his 
embarkation.</p>
<p>In those times of war, a voyage to India was a perilous and 
lengthy undertaking.&nbsp; A whole fleet was collected, 
containing merchant, convict, and transport vessels, all under 
the convoy of the ships of war belonging to the Company; and, as 
no straggler might be left behind, the progress of the whole was 
dependent on the rate of sailing of the slowest, and all were 
impeded by the disaster of one.&nbsp; The <i>Union</i>, in which 
a passage was given to the chaplain, contained, besides the crew,
passengers, the 59th Regiment, some other soldiers, and young 
cadets, all thrown closely together for many months.&nbsp; She 
sailed from Portsmouth on the 17th of July; but in two 
days&rsquo; time one of the many casualties attendant on at least
sixty vessels made the fleet put into Falmouth, where it remained
for three weeks.&nbsp; This opportunity of intercourse with his 
<!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
76</span>family might well seem an especial boon of Providence to
the young missionary, who had denied himself a last visit to 
them, and he carried away much comfort from this meeting.&nbsp; 
His sister was engaged to be suitably married, so that he was 
relieved from care on her account, and some hope was entertained 
that Lydia would be able to come out to him in India.&nbsp; A 
correspondence likewise began, which has been in great part 
preserved.&nbsp; Two days after weighing anchor, the <i>Union</i>
still lingered on the coast, and the well-known outline, with 
Mount&rsquo;s Bay, the spire of St. Hilary&rsquo;s church, and 
all the landmarks so dear and familiar to the young 
Cornishman&rsquo;s eye and heart, were watched from morning to 
night with keen pain and grief, but with steadfast resolve and 
constant inward prayer.</p>
<p>Then he addressed himself to the duties of the voyage.&nbsp; 
Private study of Hebrew and of Hindostanee was of course a part; 
but he hoped to be useful to his companions as a friend and as a 
minister.&nbsp; He could only obtain permission to hold one 
service every Sunday, but he hoped to do much by private 
conversations and prayers, and he tried to gain over the cadets 
by offering to assist them in their studies, especially 
mathematics.&nbsp; Some of them had the sense to see that the 
teaching of a senior wrangler was no small advantage, and these 
read with him throughout the voyage; but in general they were but
raw lads, and followed the example of their superiors, who for 
the most part were strongly set against Mr. Martyn.&nbsp; Those 
were the times when sailors were utterly uncared for, and when 
<i>mauvais sujets</i> at home were sent out to India to the 
corruptions of a luxurious climate and a heathen 
atmosphere.&nbsp; Men of this stamp would think it bad enough to 
have a parson on board at all, and when they found that he was a 
faithful priest, who held himself bound not to leave them 
unchecked in their evil courses, they thought themselves 
aggrieved.&nbsp; Nor was his manner likely to gain them.&nbsp; 
Grave and earnest, he had never in his life known sportiveness, 
and his distress and horror at the profanity and blasphemy that 
rang in his ears made him doubly sad and stern.&nbsp; From the 
first his Sunday service was by most treated as an infliction, 
and the officers, both of the ship and of the military, had so 
little sense of decency as to sit drinking, smoking, and talking 
within earshot.&nbsp; The persons who professed to attend showed 
no reverence of attitude; and when he endeavoured to make an 
impression on the soldiers <!-- page 77--><a 
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>and their 
wives between-decks, he was met with the same rude and careless 
inattention.</p>
<p>With very little experience of mankind, he imagined that these
hardened beings could be brought to repent by terror, and his 
discourses were full of denunciations of the wrath of God.&nbsp; 
He was told that, if he threatened them thus, they would not come
to hear him, and his reply was an uncompromising sermon on the 
text, &ldquo;The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the 
people that forget God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bravery of the thing, 
and the spirit of truth and love that pervaded all he said on 
this solemn verse, was not lost upon all: some of the cadets were
moved to tears, and an impression was made upon several 
persons.&nbsp; Indeed, there was much that should have induced 
serious thought, for, after having touched at Madeira and the 
Azores, it was made known that the 59th was to be disembarked at 
the Cape, to assist in the struggle then going on between the 
English and Dutch.&nbsp; Moreover, there was much sickness on 
board, and the captain himself, who had been always bitterly 
opposed to Mr. Martyn, anxiously called for him to attend upon 
his death-bed.</p>
<p>The 59th were landed in Table Bay just in time to take part in
Sir David Baird&rsquo;s victory.&nbsp; Martyn went on shore the 
next day to do his best for the wounded; but they were mostly in 
hospital, and, being Dutch, he could do little for them.&nbsp; He
found congenial spirits among the Dutch clergy in Cape Town, and 
spent a happy month there, but the latter part of his voyage was 
not more satisfactory than the first.&nbsp; The educated portion 
of the passengers continued to set their faces against him, 
treating him with increased contempt, and even turning into 
ridicule the farewell sermon, in which he took an affectionate 
leave of all who had sailed with him.</p>
<p>It may be that his manner was ill-judged, but it is a fearful 
thing to find that it was possible for so many Christian people 
to have been in daily contact with as true a saint as ever lived,
and yet make him their mock!&nbsp; Perhaps some of his words, and
far more his example, may have borne fruit in after years, such 
as he never knew of.</p>
<p>The whole voyage had lasted nearly ten months before entering 
the Hooghly.&nbsp; While ascending the stream, the lassitude 
produced by the climate was so great that Martyn&rsquo;s spirits 
sank under it: he thought he should &ldquo;lead an idle, <!-- 
page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
78</span>worthless life to no purpose.&nbsp; Exertion seemed like
death; indeed, absolutely impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet at the 
least he could write, &ldquo;Even if I should never see a native 
converted, God may design, by my patience and continuance, to 
encourage future missionaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This feeling of exhaustion was the prelude to a severe attack 
of fever, which assailed him almost immediately after his 
arrival; but happily not till he was safely lodged at Aldeen, in 
the kindly house of the Rev. David Brown, where he was nursed 
till his recovery.&nbsp; His friends wanted to keep him among the
English at Calcutta, but his heart was set on ministering to the 
heathen, and the sights and sounds of idolatry that constantly 
met him increased his eagerness.&nbsp; He once rushed out at the 
sight of the flames of a Suttee, hoping to rescue the victim, but
she had perished before he reached the spot.</p>
<p>His arrival was when the alarm about the meeting at Vellore 
was at its height, and when the colony at Serampore had been 
forbidden to preach or distribute tracts in Calcutta.&nbsp; He by
no means agreed with all the Baptist doctrines, but he held in 
great esteem and reverence such men as Carey and Marshman, was 
glad to profit by their experience and instructions, and heartily
sympathised in all their difficulties.&nbsp; Mr. Carey might well
write, &ldquo;A young clergyman, Mr. Martyn, is lately arrived, 
who is possessed with a truly missionary spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Together the Serampore missionaries, with Mr. Martyn, Mr. Corrie,
and Mr. Brown, united in dedicating to the worship of God a 
heathen pagoda, which the last-mentioned had succeeded in 
purchasing from the natives.&nbsp; Altogether he was much cheered
and refreshed.&nbsp; During the time that he waited at Aldeen he 
improved himself in Hindostanee, and began to study Sanscrit, and
learnt the most approved method of dealing with the 
natives.&nbsp; Moreover, he found that his allowance as a 
chaplain was so liberal as amply to justify him in writing to 
urge Miss Grenfell to come out and join him; and, during the long
period of sixteen or eighteen months before her refusal to do so 
reached him, he was full of the hope of receiving her.</p>
<p>His appointed station was Dinapore, where his primary duty was
to minister to the English troops there posted, and to the 
families of the civilians; but he also hoped to establish native 
<!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>schools, to preach in their own language to the Hindoos,
and to scatter translations of portions of Scripture, such as the
Parables, among them.</p>
<p>He had to read prayers to the soldiers from the drum-head by 
way of desk; there were no seats, and he was desired to omit the 
sermon: but afterwards a room was provided, and then the families
of the officers and residents began to attend, though at first 
they were much scandalized by his preaching extempore.&nbsp; In 
fact there was a good deal in his whole tone that startled old 
orthodoxy; and in the opposition with which he met at times, 
there was some lawful and just distrust of the 
<i>onesidedness</i> of his tenets, together with the ordinary 
hatred and dislike of darkness to light.&nbsp; So scrupulous was 
he in the Jewish force given by his party to the Fourth 
Commandment, that, having one Sunday conceived the plan of 
translating the Prayer-book into Hindostanee, he worked at it 
till he had reached the end of the <i>Te Deum</i>; and there, 
doubting whether it were a proper employment for the day, 
desisted until the Monday, to give himself up to prayer, singing 
hymns, Scripture-reading, and meditation.&nbsp; The immediate 
value of this work was for the poor native wives of the English 
soldiers, whom he found professing Christianity, but utterly 
ignorant; and to them every Sunday, after the official English 
service, he repeated the Liturgy in the vulgar tongue.&nbsp; In 
this holy work he was the pioneer, since Swartz&rsquo;s service 
was in Tamul.&nbsp; While working at his translations with his 
moonshee, or interpreter, a Mussulman, he had much opportunity 
for conversation and for study of the Mahometan arguments, so as 
to be very useful to himself; though he could not succeed in 
convincing the impracticable moonshee, who had all that 
self-satisfaction belonging to Mahometanism.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told 
him that he ought to pray that God would teach him what the truth
really is.&nbsp; He said he had no occasion to pray on this 
subject, as the word of God is express.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the 
Hindoos at Dinapore, he found, to his surprise, that there was 
apparently little disinclination to &ldquo;become 
Feringees,&rdquo; as they called it, outwardly; but the 
difficulty lay in his insistance on Christian faith and 
obedience, instead of a mere external profession.</p>
<p>It was while he was at Dinapore that we first acquire anything
like a distinct idea of Henry Martyn; for there a short halt of 
the 53rd Regiment brought him in contact with one <!-- page 
80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>who 
had an eye to observe, a heart to honour, and a pen to describe 
him; namely, Mrs. Sherwood, the wife of the paymaster, a woman of
deeply religious sentiments and considerable powers as an 
author.&nbsp; Mutual friends had already prepared Mr. Martyn to 
expect to find like-minded companions in the Sherwoods, invited 
to stay with him for the few days of their sojourn at 
Dinapore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s quarters,&rdquo; says 
that lady, &ldquo;were in the smaller square&mdash;a church-like 
abode, with little furniture, the rooms wide and high, with many 
vast doorways, having their green jalousied doors, and long 
verandahs encompassing two sides of the quarters.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
scanty, indeed, was the furniture, that, though he gave up his 
own bedroom, Mrs. Sherwood could not find a pillow, not only 
there, but in the whole house; and, with a severe pain in her 
face, could get nothing to lay her head on &ldquo;but a bolster 
stuffed as hard as a pin-cushion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thus describes the first sight of her 
host:&mdash;&ldquo;He was dressed in white, and looked very pale,
which, however, was nothing singular in India; his hair, a light 
brown, was raised from his forehead, which was a remarkably fine 
one.&nbsp; His features were not regular, but the expression was 
so luminous, so intellectual, so affectionate, so beaming with 
Divine charity, that no one could have looked at his features and
thought of their shape or form; the outbeaming of his soul would 
absorb the attention of every observer.&nbsp; There was a very 
decided air, too, of the gentleman about Mr. Martyn, and a 
perfection of manners which, from his extreme attention to all 
minute civilities, might seem almost inconsistent with the 
general bent of his thoughts to the most serious subjects.&nbsp; 
He was as remarkable for ease as for cheerfulness.&nbsp; He did 
not appear like one who felt the necessity of contending with the
world and denying himself its delights, but, rather, as one who 
was unconscious of the existence of any attractions in the world,
or of any delights which were worthy of his notice.&nbsp; When he
relaxed from his labours in the presence of his friends, it was 
to play and laugh like an innocent child, more especially if 
children were present to play and laugh with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His labours were the incessant charge of the English, 
travelling often great distances to baptize, marry, or bury, 
together with constant teaching in the schools he had established
both for the English and natives, attendance on the <!-- page 
81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>sick 
in the hospitals, and likewise private arguments with Mahometans 
and Hindoos.&nbsp; Public preachings in the streets and bazaars, 
like those of Swartz, Carey, and Ward, he does not seem to have 
attempted at this time; but his translations were his great and 
serious employment, and one that gave him much delight.&nbsp; His
thorough classical education and scholarship fitted him for this 
in an unusual degree, and besides the Hindostanee version of the 
Prayer-book, the Persian&mdash;so much wanted in the Bombay 
Presidency&mdash;was committed to him; and an assistant was sent 
to him, whose history, disappointing as it is, cannot be omitted 
from the account of Indian missions.</p>
<p>Sabat was an Arab of the tribe of Koreish, the same which gave
birth to Mahomet himself.&nbsp; He was born on the banks of the 
Euphrates, and educated in such learning as still lingered about 
the city of the Khalifs; but he left home early, and served in 
the Turkish army against the French at Acre.&nbsp; Afterwards he 
became a soldier in the Persian army, where he was several times 
wounded, and in consequence retired, and, wandering into Cabul, 
there rose to be a royal secretary.</p>
<p>He formed a close friendship with his colleague, Abdallah, 
likewise a Koreishite Arab, and very able and poetical.&nbsp; 
When the Wahabees, the straitest sect of the Mussulmans, seized 
Mecca, their chief wrote a letter to the King of Cabul, which was
committed to Abdallah to translate into Persian.&nbsp; By way of 
a graceful compliment, he put his translation into Persian verse,
and the reward he received was equally strange; namely, the gift 
of as many pearls as could be stuffed into his mouth at 
once.&nbsp; He was, however, observed to be unusually grave and 
thoughtful, and to frequent the house of an Armenian&mdash;of 
course a Christian: but as this person had a beautiful daughter, 
she was supposed to be the attraction, and no suspicion was 
excited by his request to retire into his own country.</p>
<p>Soon after Sabat was made prisoner by the Tartars of Bokhara, 
and, by appealing to the king, as a descendant of the prophet, 
obtained his release and promotion to high honour.&nbsp; While 
visiting the city of Bokhara, he recognized his old friend, 
Abdallah, and, perceiving that his beard was shaved off, examined
him on the cause so closely that he was driven to confess that 
the Armenian had converted him to the Christian faith, and that 
he did not wish to be known.&nbsp; Hereditary Christians are 
tolerated by the Moslem, but converts are <!-- page 82--><a 
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>bitterly 
persecuted; and Sabat flew into a great rage, argued, threatened,
and at last denounced his old friend to the Moollahs as a 
recreant from Islam.</p>
<p>Abdallah was arrested, and showed himself a true and faithful 
confessor and martyr.&nbsp; The Moollahs strove hard to make him 
recant.&nbsp; They demanded of him: &ldquo;In the Gospel of 
Christ, is anything said of our Prophet?&rdquo;&mdash;intending 
to extort that promise of the Comforter which Mahomet 
blasphemously applied to himself.</p>
<p>Abdallah&rsquo;s answer was: &ldquo;Yea&mdash;Beware of false 
prophets which come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but 
inwardly are ravening wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brave reply was requited by blows on the mouth till the 
blood flowed, and Sabat thought of the day he had seen that same 
mouth filled with pearls.&nbsp; Abdallah was sent back to prison,
and four days were allowed him in which to recant; after which he
was brought out and set before an assembled multitude.&nbsp; 
Pardon was offered him if he would deny his Lord, and, on his 
refusal, his left hand was cut off.&nbsp; The look of deep sorrow
and pity he gave the former friend who had betrayed him sunk deep
into Sabat&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Again his life was offered, again
he confessed himself a Christian, and finally his martyrdom was 
completed by cutting off his head.</p>
<p>This history Sabat told with feeling and earnestness, that 
convinced his hearers of its truth; and from this he did not 
vary, though his account of his own subsequent adventures varied 
so much that it was not possible at last to attach credence to 
anything he said of himself before he became expounder of 
Mohammedan Law in the Civil Court at Vizagapatam.&nbsp; At any 
rate Abdallah&rsquo;s look dwelt with him; he detected 
discrepancies in the Koran, and became anxious to study the 
Christian Scriptures.&nbsp; He obtained from Bombay a copy, first
of the New Testament, then of the Old, and, having become 
convinced, he came to Madras, and demanded baptism from Dr. Ker, 
the British chaplain.&nbsp; After some probation, which made 
Sabat so impatient that he threatened that he should accuse the 
minister before God if he delayed, he was baptized by the name of
Nathanael, and sent to Serampore as a person likely to be useful 
in the translations always in hand there.</p>
<p>He was delighted with the habits there prevailing, dismissed 
his attendants, dined at the common table, and altogether 
conformed <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>himself to the spirit of the 
place.&nbsp; When it was decided to send him to Dinapore to 
assist Mr. Martyn in rendering the Bible into Persian, he took 
leave of Serampore with tears in his eyes.&nbsp; He was gladly 
welcomed by Mr. Martyn, and they worked together at the Gospel of
St. Matthew, Sabat showing a scholar-like anxiety both for 
correctness and rhythm; but there was so much of the wild Arab 
about him that he was a continual anxiety.&nbsp; The Serampore 
missionaries thought him a grand, dignified figure.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Sherwood paints him much less pleasantly, and says he was exactly
like the sign of the Saracen&rsquo;s head, with intensely 
flashing eyes, high nose, white teeth, and jet black eyebrows, 
moustache, and beard.&nbsp; His voice was like rolling thunder, 
his dress of gorgeous material and thoroughly Oriental, silk 
skull-cap, jacket, jewelled girdle, loose trousers, and 
embroidered shoes, and he had a free and haughty manner, 
according with his signature, when writing to a gentleman who had
offended him&mdash;&ldquo;Nathanael Sabat, an Arab, who never was
in bondage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In April 1809, Mr. Martyn was removed to the station at 
Cawnpore, where the Sherwoods were then residing.&nbsp; The time 
was one of the worst in the whole year for travelling across the 
sandy plains, with a wind blowing that made the air like 
&ldquo;the mouth of an oven.&rdquo;&nbsp; For two days and two 
nights, between Allahabad and Cawnpore, Mr. Martyn travelled in 
his palanquin without intermission, and, having expected to 
arrive sooner, he had brought no provision for the last 
day.&nbsp; &ldquo;I lay in my palanquin, faint, with a headache, 
neither awake nor asleep, between dead and alive, the wind 
blowing flames.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he arrived, Mr. Sherwood had 
only just time to lead him into the bungalow before he fainted 
away, and the hall being the least heated place, a couch was made
ready for him there, where for some days he lay very ill; and the
thermometer was never below 96&deg;, though the punkah never 
ceased.</p>
<p>As soon as he mended a little, he enjoyed talking over his 
Hebrew and Greek studies and his ethnological researches with his
clever and eager hostess, who must have greatly refreshed his 
spirit.&nbsp; He delighted in music: his voice and ear were both 
excellent, and he taught her many hymns and their tunes.&nbsp; He
also took much pleasure in a little orphan girl whom she was 
bringing up.&nbsp; At this time she herself was almost a 
childless mother, all her Indian-born infants having been victims
to the <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>climate; but a few months later Mr. 
Martyn christened her little daughter Lucy, a child of such 
gentle, gracious temper that he was wont to call her 
Serena.&nbsp; Mrs. Sherwood gives a pretty picture of this little
creature, when about eighteen months old, creeping up to Mr. 
Martyn as he lay on a sofa with all his books about him, and 
perching herself on his Hebrew Lexicon, which he needed every 
moment, but would not touch so as to disturb her.&nbsp; The pale,
white-clad pastor, and the child with silky hair, bare white feet
and arms, and little muslin frock, looked equally innocent and 
pure.</p>
<p>Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s house at Cawnpore was at the end of an 
avenue of palms and aloes: there were two bungalows connected by 
a long passage, in one of which he himself lived, the other was 
given up to Sabat and his wife.&nbsp; The garden was prettily 
laid out with shrubs and tall trees, with a raised platform in 
the centre; and on one side was a whole colony, consisting not 
only of the usual number of servants allowed to a military 
chaplain, but of a host of pundits, moonshees, schoolmasters, and
poor nominal Christians, who hung about him because there was no 
one else to give them a handful of rice for their daily 
maintenance.</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Sherwood describes a motley entertainment, at which 
she was the only lady.&nbsp; Her husband, in his scarlet and gold
uniform, and Mr. Martyn, in his clerical black silk coat, were 
the only other English.&nbsp; The other European present was 
Padre Giulio Cesare, an Italian Franciscan, whom Mr. Martyn was 
obliged to receive when he came to minister to the numerous Irish
Roman Catholics in the regiment.&nbsp; He wore a purple satin 
cassock, a cord of twisted silk, a rosary of costly stones, and a
little skull-cap, and his languages were French with the 
Sherwoods, and Italian and Latin with Mr. Martyn.&nbsp; Sabat was
there in his Arab dress; there was a thin, copper-coloured, 
half-caste gentleman in white nankeen, speaking only Bengalee; 
and a Hindoo in full costume, speaking only his native tongue: so
that no two of the party were in similar costume, seven languages
were employed, and moreover the three Orientals viewed it as good
breeding to shout at the very top of their voices.</p>
<p>Unluckily, too, Mr. Martyn in his politeness suddenly 
recollected that Mrs. Sherwood had expressed a liking for certain
mutton patties, and ordered them to be brought, in a 
bachelor&rsquo;s <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>entire oblivion whether any mutton 
was procurable otherwise than by killing a sheep: and the delay 
forced the guests to continue to sit on the platform in the dark,
with the voices and languages making too great a Babel for the 
night-enjoyment sometimes so valued, when Mr. Martyn would show 
Mrs. Sherwood our own Pole Star just above the horizon, or watch 
the new moon &ldquo;looking like a ball of ebony in a silver 
cup.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last the patties were ready, and Mr. Martyn 
handed Mrs. Sherwood to a seat by him at the top of the table, 
while Sabat perched himself cross-legged upon a chair at the 
bottom.</p>
<p>The good chaplain&rsquo;s simplicity seems to have been a 
great amusement to the Sherwoods.&nbsp; Late one evening he 
quietly observed, &ldquo;The coolie does not come with my money: 
I was thinking this morning how rich I should be, and now I 
should not wonder in the least if he has run off and taken my 
treasure with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon it turned out that, not
having drawn his pay for some time, he had sent a note to the 
collector at Cawnpore, asking that the amount should be forwarded
by the bearer, a common coolie.&nbsp; It was all paid in silver, 
tied up in cotton bags, and no one expected that he would ever 
see it; however, the coolie arrived safely with it a little 
later.&nbsp; Another time, when each household had ordered a 
pineapple cheese, it was observed that the fissures in the two 
were marvellously similar; and at last it was discovered that the
servants, though paid for two cheeses, made one do duty for both,
appearing in turn at the two tables, which was the easier as Mr. 
Martyn supped on limes and other fruits, and only produced his 
cheese when the Sherwoods came to supper.&nbsp; He heeded little 
but his immediate thoughts, and, when he drove out in his gig, 
went on with his disquisitions on language and pronunciation, 
utterly unheeding what his horse was about.</p>
<p>The hope of having Lydia with him to brighten his life and aid
his labours had by this time passed away.&nbsp; She had some 
entanglement which prevented her from coming out to India, and 
his disappointment was most acute.&nbsp; His letters urging her 
to come out to him are so strong, and full of such anguish, that 
it is hard to understand that the person who could withstand them
could have been the admirable woman Miss Grenfell is described to
have been in after-life&mdash;unless, indeed, Martyn did not 
appreciate the claims at home to which she yielded.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Why do things go so well with them and so hardly with 
me?&rdquo; <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>was a thought that would come into 
his mind at the weddings where he officiated as priest.&nbsp; 
Meantime he had established native schools, choosing a master, 
usually a Mussulman, and giving him an anna a head for each boy 
whom he obtained as a scholar in reading and writing.&nbsp; Mr. 
Martyn supplied books, and these were translations of Scripture 
history, of the Parables, and the like, through which he hoped to
lay a foundation for distinctive teaching.&nbsp; Here is Mrs. 
Sherwood&rsquo;s description of the Cawnpore school, then in a 
long shed by the side of the cavalry lines:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The master sat at one end like a tailor on the dusty 
floor, and along under the shed sat the scholars, a pack of 
little urchins with no other clothes on than a skull-cap and a 
piece of cloth round their loins.&nbsp; These little ones 
squatted, like their master, in the sand: they had wooden 
imitations of slates in their hands, on which, having first 
written their lessons with chalk, they recited them <i>&agrave; 
pleine gorge</i>, as the French would say, being sure to raise 
their voices on the approach of any European or native of 
note.&nbsp; Now Cawnpore is one of the most dusty places in the 
world; the Sepoy lines are the most dusty part of Cawnpore; and 
as the little urchins are always well greased either with 
cocoa-nut oil, or, in failure thereof, with rancid mustard oil, 
whenever there was the slightest breath of air they always looked
as if they had been powdered all over with brown powder.&nbsp; 
Who that has ever heard it, can forget the sounds of the various 
notes with which these little people intonated their 
&lsquo;Aleph, Zubbin ah, Zair a, Paiche oh,&rsquo; as they moved 
backwards and forwards in their recitations?&nbsp; Who can forget
the self-importance of the schoolmaster, who was generally a 
grey-bearded, dry, old man, who had no other means of proving his
superiority to the scholars than by making more noise than even 
they could?&rdquo;</p>
<p>

<img alt="Henry Martyn&rsquo;s first endeavour at native 
preaching" src="images/p1s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In the winter of 1809, Mr. Martyn made his first endeavour at 
native preaching.&nbsp; The Yogis and Fakers, devotees and 
vagrants, haunted the station, and every Sunday evening he opened
the gates of his garden, admitted all who were collected by the 
assurance of the distribution of a pice a head; and standing on 
his platform, read to them some simple verse of Scripture, and 
then endeavoured to make them believe there is a pure Almighty 
Universal Father.&nbsp; A frightful crowd: they were often five 
hundred in number.&nbsp; &ldquo;No dreams,&rdquo; says Mrs. <!-- 
page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>Sherwood, &ldquo;in the delirium of a raging fever, 
could surpass the realities&rdquo; of their appearance; 
&ldquo;clothed with abominable rags, or nearly without clothes, 
or plastered with mud and cow-dung, or with long matted locks 
streaming down to their heels; every countenance foul and 
frightful with evil passions; the lips black with tobacco, or 
crimson with henna.&nbsp; One man, who came in a cart drawn by a 
bullock, was so bloated as to look like an enormous frog; another
had kept an arm above his head with his hand clenched till the 
nail had come out at the back of his hand; and one very tall man 
had all his bones marked on his dark skin with white chalk, like 
the figure of grim Death himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; The assemblage, in
contrast with the pure, innocent, pale face and white dress of 
the preacher who addressed them, must have been like some of 
Gustave Dor&eacute;&rsquo;s illustrations.</p>
<p>These addresses were jealously watched by the British 
authorities, and were often interrupted by the howls and 
threatenings of his loathsome congregation; while, moreover, 
pulmonary complaint, the enemy of his family, began to manifest 
itself, so that the physicians insisted on his trying the effect 
of cessation from work, a sea-voyage, and a visit to 
England.&nbsp; On this plan he had at first fixed.&nbsp; He 
enters in his journal a happy dream of a walk with Lydia, and, 
waking, the recollection of the 16,000 miles between them; but in
the meantime he heard from the critics at Calcutta, that his 
translation of the Gospels into Persian, done with the assistance
of Sabat, was too full of Arabic idioms, and in language not 
simple enough for its purpose; and he therefore made up his mind 
to spend his leave of absence in making his way through Persia 
and part of Arabia, so as to improve himself in the languages, 
and submit his translation to more trustworthy scholars.&nbsp; 
Mr. Brown, on hearing of his plan, consented in these remarkable 
terms: &ldquo;Can I then bring myself to cut the string and let 
you go?&nbsp; I confess I could not if your bodily frame were 
strong, and promised to last for half a century.&nbsp; But as you
burn with the intenseness and rapid blaze of phosphorus, why 
should we not make the most of you?&nbsp; Your flame may last as 
long, and perhaps longer, in Arabia than in India.&nbsp; Where 
should the ph&oelig;nix build her odoriferous nest but in the 
land prophetically called the &lsquo;blessed&rsquo;?&nbsp; And 
where shall we ever expect but from that country the true 
Comforter to come to the nations of the East?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>In September, therefore, Henry Martyn made ready to set 
forth, and to take leave of his congregation of beggars.&nbsp; He
had baptized one poor old Hindoo woman, and she seemed to him to 
be the only fruit of his toils; but though the exhortation, at 
the end of all his labours of the Sunday, cost him severe pain 
and exhaustion, he had constantly persisted, often beginning in a
low feeble tone, but gradually rising in fervour to the full 
power of his musical voice; then himself going among the 
disgusting throng to distribute their petty bribe for attendance,
and often falling afterwards, faint and speechless, on a 
sofa.</p>
<p>He knew not that one seed, cast on these turbid waters, had 
found good soil, and was springing up.&nbsp; Sheik Salah was the 
son of a pundit at Delhi, and was well-learned in Persian and 
Arabic.&nbsp; When a youth he had become moonshee to two English 
gentlemen then living at Lucknow, and while in their service 
converted a Hindoo fellow-servant from his idolatry to 
Islam.&nbsp; Elated with his success, he gave himself such airs 
that his English masters reproved him; and he left them in 
displeasure, vowing never to serve a Feringhee again.&nbsp; 
However, being in the pay of a Mahratta chief, he was sent in 
company with a Mahometan envoy who had undertaken to murder a 
rival of his master, and having lulled his victim into security 
by an oath on the Koran that no treachery was intended, decoyed 
him into his tent, and there stabbed him.</p>
<p>Sheik Salah was a deeply conscientious man, and not only did 
he leave the Mahratta service, lest some such horrible act should
be required of him, but he conceived a certain distrust of his 
own faith, which, though it condemns such deeds, had not hindered
them.&nbsp; While in search of employment, he came to Cawnpore, 
and there, one fine evening, he sat with some other young 
Mussulmans, in a summer-house on the garden wall that bounded Mr.
Martyn&rsquo;s garden, enjoying their hookahs and sherbet, and 
amusing themselves with what they called the 
&ldquo;foolishness&rdquo; of the Feringhee Padre, who was 
discoursing to the throng of hateful looking beggars below.&nbsp;
By and by, anxious to hear more, they came down, entered the 
garden, and stood in a row before the front of the bungalow; 
their arms folded, their turbans placed jauntily on one side, and
their countenances expressive of the utmost contempt.</p>
<p>But the words that Sheik Salah caught were sinking deep.&nbsp;
They were of the intense purity and holiness of God and of <!-- 
page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
89</span>His laws, and of the need of His power to attain to the 
keeping of them, as well as of His Sacrifice to atone for 
man&rsquo;s sinfulness.&nbsp; Sheik Salah could not rest without 
hearing more, and becoming determined to obtain employment at 
Cawnpore, he undertook to copy Persian manuscripts for Sabat, and
was lodged by him in one of the numerous huts in Mr. 
Martyn&rsquo;s compound.&nbsp; He was a well-educated, graceful 
man, exceedingly handsome, looking like a hero of the Old 
Testament; and probably Sabat was afraid of a rival, for he never
mentioned to Mr. Martyn the stranger who, Sunday after Sunday, 
listened to his preaching, and no doubt would have as thankfully 
profited by his individual teaching as he would have joyfully 
given it.</p>
<p>Sabat was at this time a great trial to Mr. Martyn, who in the
flush of enthusiasm had let him be put too forward at first, and 
found the wild man of the desert far too strong for him.&nbsp; 
Sometimes, when they differed about a word in the translation, 
Sabat would contend so violently for a whole morning that poor 
Mr. Martyn, when unable to bear it any longer, would order his 
palanquin and be carried over to the Sherwoods to escape from the
intolerable brawling shout.&nbsp; What Sabat could be was plain 
from the story of his wife Amina; his seventh, as he told his 
friends.&nbsp; When he was trying to convert her, she asked his 
views upon the future lot of those who remained Mahometans, and, 
when he consigned them to the state of condemnation, she quietly 
replied that she greatly preferred hell without Sabat&rsquo;s 
company to heaven with him.&nbsp; The poor man was no doubt in 
great measure sincere, but his probation had been insufficient, 
and his wild Ishmaelitish nature, so far from being overcome, 
gained in pride and violence through the enthusiasm that was felt
for him as a convert.&nbsp; Once, in a fit of indignation, he 
wrote a Persian letter, full of abuse of Mr. Martyn, to a friend 
in the service of the English resident at Lucknow.&nbsp; By him 
it was carried to his master, who, wishing to show Mr. Martyn the
real character of his favourite convert, sent him the 
letter.&nbsp; Instead of looking into it, Mr. Martyn summoned 
Sabat, and bade him read it aloud to him.&nbsp; For once the Arab
was overpowered; he cowered before his calm master and entreated 
his pardon, and when Mr. Martyn put the letter into his hands, 
assuring him that he had not read it, he was really touched, and 
showed sorrow for his violence.</p>
<p>On the last Sunday of September 1810, Mr. Martyn took <!-- 
page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
90</span>leave of Cawnpore.&nbsp; It was also the Sunday of the 
installation as chaplain of his dearest friend, the Reverend 
Daniel Corrie, and of the opening of a church which his exertions
had prevailed to raise, whereas all former services had been in 
his own long verandah.&nbsp; The first sound of the bell most 
deeply affected those who had scarcely heard one since they had 
left their native country.&nbsp; That church has given place to 
the beautiful building which commemorates the horrors of 1857; 
but the name of Henry Martyn ought never to be forgotten at 
Cawnpore, if only as the priest to whom it was granted first to 
give thanks that, in his own words, &ldquo;a temple of God was 
erected and a door opened for the service of the Almighty in a 
place where, from the foundation of the world, the tabernacle of 
the true God had never stood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After returning from church he sank, nearly fainting, on a 
sofa in the hall; but, as soon as he revived, begged his friends 
to sing to him.&nbsp; The hymn was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O God, our help in ages past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our hope in years to come,<br />
Our shelter from the stormy blast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And our eternal home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the early dinner and afternoon rest, on a sickly, hazy, 
burning evening, he preached for the last time to his beggars; 
came away fainting, and as he lay on his sofa told his friends 
that he did not believe that he had ever made the slightest 
impression on <i>one</i> of his audience there.</p>
<p>He knew not that Sheik Salah&rsquo;s heart had been touched, 
and so deeply that he sought further instruction.&nbsp; As to 
Sabat, his later career was piteous.&nbsp; He fell back into 
Mahometanism, and, after some years of a wandering life, took 
service with the Mussulman chief of Acheen in Sumatra, where, 
having given some offence, he was barbarously hacked to pieces 
and thrown into the sea.&nbsp; Such bitter disappointments occur 
in missionary life; and how should we wonder, since the like 
befel even St. Paul and St. John?</p>
<p>On the 1st of October, 1810, Mr. Martyn embarked on the 
Ganges, and on the last day of the month arrived at Mr. 
Brown&rsquo;s house at Aldeen.&nbsp; He was then much the 
stronger for the long rest to his voice and chest, but his 
friends thought him greatly changed and enfeebled, and he could 
not even hold a conversation <!-- page 91--><a 
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>without 
bringing on painful symptoms.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he preached 
every Sunday but one at Calcutta until the 7th of January, 1811, 
when he took his last leave of his Anglo-Indian friends, and set 
forth on his journey to lands almost entirely strange even to his
countrymen, in the hope of rendering the Scriptures available for
the study of the numerous Hindoos and Mahometans who understood 
Persian better than any other literary language.&nbsp; He went 
forth, in broken health, and not only without a companion, but 
without even an attendant, and for his further history we have 
only his own journals and letters to depend upon.&nbsp; He went 
by sea to Bombay with a captain who had been a pupil of Swartz, 
and whose narratives delighted him much, and afterwards obtained 
a passage in an English ship which was to cruise in the Persian 
Gulf against Arab pirates.&nbsp; Here he was allowed to have 
public prayers every evening, and on the 22nd of May was landed 
at Bushire, where he was lodged in the house of an English 
merchant with an Armenian wife.</p>
<p>The time for a journey to Persia was so far favourable that 
the Shah, Fath&rsquo; Ali, who had succeeded to the throne in 
1794, owed England much gratitude for having interfered to check 
the progress of Russian conquest upon his northern 
frontier.&nbsp; After Persia had long been closed from foreign 
intercourse by the jealous and cruel Shah, Aga Mohammed, 
Fath&rsquo; Ali, a comparatively enlightened prince in the prime 
of life, willingly entertained envoys and travellers from 
European courts, and Sir Gore Ouseley was resident at Shiraz as 
British Ambassador.&nbsp; Yet it was not considered safe for a 
Frank to travel through Persia without an Oriental dress, and, 
accordingly, Martyn had to provide himself with the tall conical 
cap of black Tartar lambskin, baggy blue trousers, red boots, and
a chintz coat, allowing his beard and moustache to grow, and 
eating rice by handfuls from the general dish.&nbsp; Meantime he 
was hospitably entertained, the Armenian ladies came in a body to
kiss his hand, and the priest placed him beside the altar in 
church, and incensed him four times over, for which he was not 
grateful on being told &ldquo;it was for the honour of our 
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An English officer joined company with him, and a muleteer 
undertook their transport to Shiraz.&nbsp; It was a terrible 
journey up the parching mountain paths of Persia, where 
Alexander&rsquo;s army had suffered so much, with the sun glaring
down upon <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>them, never, in that rainless belt 
around the Persian Gulf, tempered by a cloud.&nbsp; They 
travelled only by night, and encamped by day, sometimes without a
tree to spread their tents under.&nbsp; The only mode of existing
was to wrap the head in a wet cloth, and the body in all the 
heavy clothing to be had, to prevent the waste of moisture; but 
even thus Martyn says his state was &ldquo;a fire within my head,
my skin like a cinder, the pulse violent.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
thermometer rose to 126&deg; in the middle of the day, and came 
down to about 100&deg; in the evening.&nbsp; When exhausted with 
fever and sleeplessness, but unable to touch food, it was needful
to mount, and, in a half-dead state of sleepiness, be carried by 
the sure-footed mountain pony up steep ascents, and along the 
verge of giddy precipices, with a general dreamy sense that it 
was magnificent scenery for any one who was in a bodily condition
to admire it.</p>
<p>Swift clear streams and emerald valleys began to refresh the 
travellers as they rose into the higher land above the arid 
region; and, after one twenty-four hours&rsquo; halt in a sort of
summer-house, where Henry Martyn was too ill to move till he had 
had a few hours of sleep, they safely arrived at the 
mountain-city of Shiraz, where he was kindly received by Jaffier 
Ali Khan, a Persian gentleman to whom he had brought letters of 
introduction.</p>
<p>Persia, as is well known, has a peculiar intellectual 
character of its own.&nbsp; Descended from the Indo-European 
stock, and preserved from total enervation by their mountain air,
the inhabitants have, even under Islam, retained much of the 
vivacity, fire, and poetry inherent in the Aryan nature.&nbsp; 
Their taste for beauty, especially in form and colour, has always
been exquisite; their delight in gardens, in music, and poetry 
has had a certain refinement, and with many terrible 
faults&mdash;in especial falsehood and cruelty, the absence of 
the Turkish stolidity, the Arab wildness, and the Hindoo pride 
and indolence&mdash;has always made them an attractive 
people.&nbsp; Their Mahommedanism, too, is of a different form 
from that of the Arab and Turk.&nbsp; Theirs is the schismatical 
sect of Ali, which is less rigid, and affords more scope for the 
intellect and fancy, and it has thrown off a curious body called 
the Soofees, a sort of philosophers in relation to Islam.&nbsp; 
The name may be either really taken from the Greek <i>Sophos</i>,
wise, or else comes from the Persian <i>Soof</i>, purity.&nbsp; 
The Soofees profess to be continually <!-- page 93--><a 
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>in search of 
truth, and seem, for the most part, to rest upon a general belief
in an all-pervading Creator, with a spirit diffused through all 
His works.&nbsp; Like their (apparent) namesakes of old, they 
revel in argument, and delight to tell or to hear some new 
thing.</p>
<p>Thus, Jaffier Ali Khan, who belonged to this sect, made the 
English padre welcome; and his brother, Seid Ali, whose title of 
Mirza shows him to have been a Scribe, undertook to assist in the
translation, while Moollahs and students delighted to come and 
hold discussions with him; and very vain and unprofitable 
logomachies he found them, whether with Soofee, Mahometan, or 
Jew.&nbsp; But the life, on the whole, was interesting, since he 
was fulfilling his most important object of providing a 
trustworthy and classical version of the Scriptures, such as 
might adequately express their meaning, and convey a sense of 
their beauty of language and force of expression to the scholarly
and fastidious Oriental.</p>
<p>He made friends in the suite of the Ambassador, Sir Gore 
Ouseley, whose house he ministered on Sunday, and he was 
presented by him to the heir to the throne, Prince Abbas 
Mirza.&nbsp; He had, by way of Court dress, to wear a pair of red
cloth stockings and high-heeled shoes, and was marched up through
the great court of the palace, where a hundred fountains began to
play the moment the Ambassador entered.&nbsp; The Prince sat on 
the ground in his hall of audience, and all his visitors sat in a
line with their hats on, but he conversed with no one but the 
Ambassador, looking so gentle and amiable that Mr. Martyn could 
hardly believe that the tyrannical acts reported of him could be 
true.</p>
<p>In the summer heat, Jaffier Ali pitched a tent for him in a 
garden outside the walls of Shiraz, where he worked with much 
enjoyment, &ldquo;living among clusters of grapes, by the side of
a clear stream,&rdquo; and sitting under the shade of an 
orange-tree.&nbsp; From thence he made an expedition to see the 
ruins of Persepolis, greatly to the perplexity of his escort, 
who, after repeatedly telling him that the place was uninhabited,
concluded that he had come thither to drink brandy in secret!</p>
<p>On the New Year&rsquo;s Day of 1812 Martyn wrote in his 
journal: &ldquo;The present year will probably be a perilous one,
but my life is of little consequence, whether I live to finish 
the Persian New Testament, or do not.&nbsp; I look back with pity
and shame on <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>my former self, and on the importance
I then attached to my life and labours.&nbsp; The more I see of 
my own works, the more I am ashamed of them.&nbsp; Coarseness and
clumsiness mar all the works of men.&nbsp; I am sick when I look 
at man, and his wisdom, and his doings, and am relieved only by 
reflecting that we have a city whose builder and maker is 
God.&nbsp; The least of <i>His</i> works is refreshing to look 
at.&nbsp; A dried leaf or a straw makes me feel myself in good 
company.&nbsp; Complacency and admiration take the place of 
disgust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 24th of February he finished his Persian New Testament,
and in six weeks more his translation of the Psalms.&nbsp; His 
residence in Persia had lasted just a year, and, though direct 
missionary work had not been possible to him there, he had 
certainly inspired his coadjutor, Mirza Seid Ali, with a much 
higher morality and with something very like faith.&nbsp; On one 
of the last days before his leaving Shiraz, Seid Ali said 
seriously, &ldquo;Though a man had no other religious society, I 
suppose he might, with the aid of the Bible, live alone with 
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was to this solitude that Martyn left him, 
not attempting apparently to induce him to give up anything for 
the sake of embracing Christianity.&nbsp; Death would probably 
have been the consequence of joining the Armenian Church in 
Persia, but why did Martyn&rsquo;s teaching stop at inward faith 
instead of insisting on outward confession, the test fixed by the
Saviour Himself?</p>
<p>On the 24th of May, Mr. Martyn and another English clergyman 
set out to lay his translation before the Shah, who was in his 
camp at Tebriz.&nbsp; There they were admitted to the presence of
the Vizier, before whom two Moollahs, the most ignorant and 
discourteous whom he had met in Persia, were set to argue with 
the English priest.&nbsp; The Vizier mingled in the discussion, 
which ended thus: &ldquo;You had better say God is God, and 
Mahomet is His prophet.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;God is God,&rdquo; 
repeated Henry Martyn, &ldquo;and <span 
class="smcap">Jesus</span> is the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is neither born nor begets,&rdquo; cried the 
Moollahs; and one said, &ldquo;What will you say when your tongue
is burnt out for blasphemy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had offended against the Mohammedan doctrine most strictly 
held; and, knowing this well, he had kept back the confession of 
the core of the true faith till to withhold it longer would have 
been a denial of his Lord.&nbsp; After all, he was not <!-- page 
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
95</span>allowed to see the Shah without the Ambassador to 
present him, and descended again to Sultania&mdash;a painful 
journey, from which he brought a severe ague and fever, through 
which he was nursed by Sir Gore and Lady Ouseley.</p>
<p>As soon as he had recovered, he decided on making his way to 
Constantinople, and thence to England, where he hoped to recruit 
his health and, it might be, induce Lydia to accompany him back 
to India.&nbsp; His last letter to her was written from Tebriz on
the 28th of August, dreading illness on the journey, but still 
full of hope.&nbsp; In that letter, too, he alludes to Sabat as 
the greatest tormentor he had known, but warns her against 
mentioning to others that this &ldquo;star of the East,&rdquo; as
Claudius Buchanan had called him, had been a 
disappointment.&nbsp; His diary is carried on as far as 
Tocat.&nbsp; The last entry is on the 6th of October.&nbsp; It 
closes thus: &ldquo;Oh! when shall time give place to 
eternity?&nbsp; When shall appear that new heaven and earth 
wherein dwelleth righteousness?&nbsp; There, there shall in 
nowise enter in anything that defileth; none of that wickedness 
which has made men worse than wild beasts, none of those 
corruptions which add still more to the miseries of mortality, 
shall be seen or heard of any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more is known of Henry Martyn save that he died at Tocat on
the 16th of that same October of 1812, without a European 
near.&nbsp; It is not even known whether his death were caused by
fever, or by the plague, which was raging at the place.&nbsp; He 
died a pilgrim&rsquo;s solitary death, and lies in an unknown 
grave in a heathen land.</p>
<p>What fruit has his mission zeal left?&nbsp; It has left one of
the soul-stirring examples that have raised up other 
labourers.&nbsp; It has left the Persian Bible for the blessing 
of all to whom that language is familiar.&nbsp; It left, for the 
time, a strong interest in Christianity in Shiraz.&nbsp; It left 
in India many English quickened to a sense of religion; and it 
assuredly left Sheik Salah a true convert.&nbsp; Baptized 
afterwards by the name of Abdul Messeh, or Servant of the 
Messiah, he became the teacher of no less than thirty-nine 
Hindoos whom he brought to Holy Baptism.&nbsp; Such were the 
reapings in Paradise that Henry Martyn has won from his 
thirty-one years&rsquo; life and his seeming failure.</p>
<h2><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
96</span>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; WILLIAM CAREY AND JOSHUA MARSHMAN, THE 
SERAMPORE MISSIONARIES.</h2>
<p>The English subjects and allies in India had hitherto owed 
their scanty lessons in Christianity to Germans or Danes, and the
first of our own countrymen who attempted the work among them 
was, to the shame of our Government be it spoken, a volunteer 
from among the humblest classes, of no more education than falls 
to the lot of the child of a village schoolmaster and parish 
clerk.</p>
<p>In 1761, when Schwartz was just beginning to make his way in 
Tanjore, William Carey was born in the village of Paulerspury, in
Northamptonshire.&nbsp; He showed himself a diligent scholar in 
his father&rsquo;s little school, and had even picked up some 
Latin before, at fourteen years old, he was apprenticed to a 
shoemaker at the neighbouring village of Hackleton.&nbsp; Still 
he had an earnest taste for study; and, falling in with a 
commentary on the New Testament full of Greek words, he copied 
them all out, and carried them for explanation to a man living in
his native village, who had thrown away a classical education by 
his dissipated habits.</p>
<p>The young shoemaker, thus struggling on to instruct himself, 
fell under the notice of Thomas Scott, the author of the 
Commentary on the Bible, and it was from him that Carey first 
received any strong religious impressions.&nbsp; Scott was a 
Baptist; and young Carey, who had grown up in the days of the 
deadness of the Church, was naturally led to his teacher&rsquo;s 
sect, and began to preach at eighteen years of age.&nbsp; He 
always looked back with humiliation to the inexperienced 
performances of his untried zeal at that time of life; but he was
doing his best to study, working hard at grammar, and every 
morning reading his portion of the Scripture for the day in 
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, as well as English.&nbsp; Well might 
Mr. Scott say, as he looked at the little cobbler&rsquo;s shop, 
&ldquo;That was Mr. Carey&rsquo;s college;&rdquo; for all this 
time he was working at his trade, and, on <!-- page 97--><a 
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>his 
master&rsquo;s death, took the business, and married the daughter
of the house before he was twenty.</p>
<p>It was an unlucky marriage, for she was a dull, ignorant 
woman, with no feeling for her husband&rsquo;s high aims or 
superior powers, and the business was not a flourishing one; but 
he never manifested anything but warm affection and tenderness 
towards this very uncompanionable person, and perhaps, like most 
men of low station and unusual intellect, had no idea that more 
could be expected of a wife.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in spite of his kindness, Mrs. Carey had to endure 
the disasters common to the wives of struggling great men: for 
William Carey&rsquo;s shoes were not equal to his sermons, and 
his congregation were too poor even to raise means to clothe him 
decently.&nbsp; His time was spent in long tramps to sell shoes 
he had made and to obtain the mending of others, and, meantime, 
he was constantly suffering from fever and ague.</p>
<p>In 1786, when in his twenty-fifth year, he obtained a little 
Baptist chapel and the goodwill of a school at Moulton; but as a 
minister he only received 16<i>l.</i> per annum, and at the same 
time proved, as many have done before him, that aptness to learn 
does not imply aptness to teach.&nbsp; He could not keep order, 
and his boys first played tricks with him and then deserted, till
he came nearly to starvation, and had to return to his last and 
his leather.</p>
<p>Yet it was the geography lessons of this poor little school 
that first found the way to the true chord of Carey&rsquo;s 
soul.&nbsp; Those broad tracts of heathenism that struck his eye 
in the map, and the summary of nations and numbers professing 
false religions, were to a mind like his no mere items of 
information to be driven into dull brains, but were terrible 
realities representing souls perishing for lack of 
knowledge.&nbsp; Cook&rsquo;s Voyages fell into his hands and fed
the growing impulse.&nbsp; He hung up in his shop a large map, 
composed of several sheets pasted together, and gazed at it when 
at his work, writing against each country whatever information he
had been able to collect as to the number of the inhabitants, 
their religion, government, or habits, also as to the climate and
natural history.</p>
<p>After he had for some time thus dwelt on the great longing of 
his heart, he ventured on speaking it forth at a meeting of 
ministers at Northampton, when there was a request that some 
topic might be named for discussion.&nbsp; Carey then modestly 
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
98</span>rose and proposed &ldquo;the duty of Christians to 
attempt the spread of the Gospel among the heathen.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The words were like a shock.&nbsp; The senior, who acted as 
president, sprang up in displeasure, and shouted out, 
&ldquo;Young man, sit down!&nbsp; When God pleases to convert the
heathen, He will do it without your aid or mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
another, namely Mr. Fuller, who afterwards became the sheet 
anchor of the Missions, describes himself as having thought of 
the words of the noble at Jezreel, &ldquo;If the Lord should make
windows in heaven, might such a thing be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silenced by his brethren, Carey persevered, and proceeded to 
write what he had not been allowed to speak.&nbsp; A Birmingham 
tradesman of the name of Pott, an opulent man, was induced by his
earnestness to begin a subscription for the publication of 
Carey&rsquo;s pamphlet, which showed wonderful acquaintance with 
the state of the countries it mentioned, and manifested talent of
a remarkable order.&nbsp; In truth, Carey had been endowed with 
that peculiar missionary gift, facility for languages.&nbsp; A 
friend gave him a large folio in Dutch, and was amazed by his 
returning shortly after with a translation into English of one of
the sermons which the book contained.</p>
<p>He was becoming more known, and an invitation from a 
congregation at Leicester, in 1789, placed him in somewhat more 
comfortable circumstances, and brought him into contact with 
persons better able to enter into his views; but it was three 
years more before he could either publish his pamphlet or take 
the very first steps towards the establishment of a Society for 
Promoting the Conversion of the Heathen.</p>
<p>The first endeavour to collect a subscription resulted in 
13<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; This was at Kettering, 
and at the same time Carey offered to embark for any country the 
Society might appoint.&nbsp; The committee, however, waited to 
collect more means, but they found it almost impossible to awaken
people&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp; At Birmingham, indeed, 70<i>l.</i> 
was collected, but in London the dissenting pastors would have 
nothing to do with the cause; and the only minister of any 
denomination who showed any sympathy was the Rev. John Newton, 
that giant of his day, who had in his youth been captain of a 
slaver, and well knew what were the dark places of the 
earth.&nbsp; The objections made at that time were perfectly 
astounding.&nbsp; In the General Assembly of the Kirk of 
Scotland, several Presbyterian <!-- page 99--><a 
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>ministers 
pronounced it to be &ldquo;highly preposterous&rdquo; to attempt 
to spread the Gospel among barbarous nations, extolled the 
&ldquo;simple virtues&rdquo; of the untutored savage, and even 
declared that the funds of Missionary Societies might be turned 
against Government.</p>
<p>In India itself, the endeavours of the Danish settlement at 
Tranquebar had little affected Bengal, but a few of the more 
religious men at Calcutta had begun to be shocked at the utter 
oblivion of all Christian faith and morality by their own 
countrymen, and the absolute favour shown to the grossest 
idolatry of the heathen.&nbsp; Charles Grant, a member of the 
Board of Trade at Calcutta, was the foremost of these, and on his
return to England brought the subject under the notice of that 
great champion of Christ, William Wilberforce.&nbsp; The charter 
of the East India Company was renewed from time to time; and when
it was brought before Parliament, Wilberforce proposed the 
insertion of clauses enforcing the maintenance of chaplains, 
churches, and schools, so that a branch of the Church might take 
root in Hindostan.</p>
<p>This scheme, however, excited violent and selfish alarm in the
directors, chiefly men who had made their fortunes in India, and 
after living there for years under no restraint were come home to
enjoy their riches.&nbsp; They believed that the natives would 
take umbrage at the least interference with their religion, and 
that their own wealth and power, so highly prized, would be lost 
if idolatry were not merely tolerated, but flattered and 
supported.&nbsp; The souls of men and the honour of God were 
nothing to them; they were furious with indignation, and procured
from the House of Commons the omission of the clauses.&nbsp; 
There was another hope in the Lords; but though Archbishop Moore 
and the Bishop of London spoke in favour of the articles, the 
Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s said one nation had no right to 
impose its faith on another.&nbsp; None of the other Bishops 
stirred, and the charter passed without one line towards keeping 
Englishmen Christians, or making Hindoos such!&nbsp; The lethargy
of the Church of the eighteenth century was so heavy that not 
only had such a son as Carey been allowed to turn from her pale 
in search of earnest religion, but while she was forced to employ
foreigners, bred up in the Lutheran communion, as the chaplains 
and missionaries of her Society for the Propagation of the 
Gospel, he was going forth unaccredited <!-- page 100--><a 
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>as a 
volunteer in the cause which her paralysed efforts could not 
support!</p>
<p>For it was to India that the minds of the little Baptist 
Society were turned by the return of one John Thomas, who seems 
to have been the Gaultier <i>Sans Avoir</i> of this 
crusade.&nbsp; He was Baptist by education, and having gone out 
as a surgeon to Calcutta, had been so shocked at the state of 
things as to begin to preach on his own account, but he was a hot
tempered, imprudent man, and quarrelled with everybody, so as to 
make the cause still more unpopular with the East Indians.&nbsp; 
Yet this strange, wild character had a wonderful power of 
awakening enthusiasm.&nbsp; He had come home in the same ship 
with one Wilson, whose history was a marvel in itself.&nbsp; He 
had been made prisoner by the French during the Carnatic war, and
finding that the captives were to be delivered up to Hyder Ali, 
he resolved to escape, leapt forty feet from his prison window, 
and swam the river Coleroon, in happy ignorance that it was 
infested with alligators; but then going up an eminence to judge 
of his bearings, he was seen, secured, and stripped naked, and, 
with his hands tied behind him, was driven before Hyder 
Ali.&nbsp; His account of having crossed the Coleroon was treated
as a lie.&nbsp; &ldquo;No mortal man,&rdquo; said the natives, 
&ldquo;had ever swum the river; did he but dip a finger in, he 
would be seized by the alligators,&rdquo; but when evidence 
proved the fact, the Nabob held up his hands and cried, 
&ldquo;This is the man of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless Wilson 
was chained to a soldier, and, like the well-known David Baird, 
John Lindsay, and many others, was driven naked, barefoot, and 
wounded, 500 miles to Seringapatam; where, loaded with irons of 
thirty-two pounds weight, and chained in couples, they were 
thrust into a &ldquo;black hole,&rdquo; and fed so scantily that 
Wilson declared that at sight of food his jaws snapped together 
of themselves.&nbsp; Many a time in the morning corpses were 
unchained, and the survivors coupled up together again.&nbsp; 
Wilson was one of the thirty-one who lived to be released after 
twenty-two months, in a frightful state of exhaustion and 
disease.&nbsp; Afterwards, when commanding a ship at Bencoolen, 
every European under his command died, and he alone escaped, yet 
all this time he was an absolute infidel; and, when having made a
fortune, he was returning home, he appeared so utterly hardened 
against all the arguments that the zealous Thomas could bring in 
favour <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>of Christianity, as to make him in 
despair remark to the chief officer that he should have more hope
of converting the Lascar sailors than of Captain Wilson.</p>
<p>However, the words were penetrating the hitherto ignorant or 
obdurate heart, and preparing it to attend to further 
instruction.&nbsp; After some years of comfort at home, on 
hearing of plans for a mission to the South Sea Islands, Wilson 
resolved to offer himself as a free and spontaneous 
fellow-worker, ready to sacrifice his whole self in the great 
cause!</p>
<p>Meantime Thomas&rsquo;s fervid account of the needs of India 
had made the infant Society propose to send him out with one 
colleague; and William Carey, now thirty-three years of age, 
offered himself as a fellow-worker.</p>
<p>The notion was terrible to Mrs. Carey, who flatly refused to 
go; but her husband decided on leaving her at home, and only 
taking his eldest boy, then about ten or eleven years old.&nbsp; 
An application was made to the Board of Directors for a licence 
to the two missionaries to preach, and for a passage in one of 
the Company&rsquo;s vessels; but when Mr. Grant learnt that 
Thomas was one of them, he refused to assist in promoting their 
request, though he undertook to do what he could for Carey 
alone.&nbsp; However, the Board were certain to refuse them a 
passage; not because they were unordained or dissenters, but 
simply because they wished to be Christian teachers.&nbsp; A 
captain with whom Thomas had sailed as surgeon, offered to 
smuggle them over without permission; but while his ship was 
preparing, they had to wait in the Isle of Wight, and Thomas was 
continually in danger of being arrested by his creditors, and was
constantly obliged to hide himself, till Carey became ashamed of 
such an associate.&nbsp; At last, just as they were on board, 
with 250<i>l.</i> paid for their passage, and the goods in which 
the money for their support had been invested, the captain 
received a letter warning him that an information was about to be
laid against him at the India House for taking out people without
permission.&nbsp; Not only missionaries, but Europeans of any 
kind, not in the public service, were forbidden to set foot on 
the Company&rsquo;s territories without special licence, and the 
danger was so great that the captain set them ashore at once; and
poor Carey beheld with tears the Indian fleet sailing from 
Portsmouth without him.</p>
<p>However, by vigorous exertion, Thomas found that a Danish ship
would be lying in the Downs, on her way to the East <!-- page 
102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
102</span>Indies, and that a passage in her would cost 
100<i>l.</i> for a full-grown person and 50<i>l.</i> for a 
child.&nbsp; Posting down to Northamptonshire, Carey made a 
desperate effort to persuade his wife to come with him, and 
succeeded at last, on condition that her sister, Miss Old, should
come too.&nbsp; There were now five children, and the 
passage-money for the whole party amounted to 600<i>l.</i>, of 
which their utmost efforts, including the sale of all the little 
property the Careys possessed, could only raise half.</p>
<p>Thomas, who really had a generous spirit, then arranged that 
the whole party should be squeezed into two cabins, and that Mr. 
and Mrs. Carey alone should be treated as first-class 
passengers.&nbsp; They were taken on these terms; but the 
captain, an Englishman, naturalized in Denmark, gave Mr. Thomas 
and Miss Old each a cabin, made them dine at his own table, and 
treated them all most kindly.</p>
<p>Thus they safely arrived at Calcutta; but this was only the 
beginning of troubles.&nbsp; The goods, the sale of which was 
intended to maintain the mission, were entrusted to Thomas, and 
realized next to nothing; and Carey was indebted to the goodwill 
of a rich Hindoo for a miserable house in an unhealthy suburb of 
Calcutta, where he lodged his unfortunate family.&nbsp; They had 
a great deal of illness, and he was able to do little but study 
the language and endeavour to translate the Bible into 
Bengalee.&nbsp; Several moves made their state rather worse than 
better, until, in 1795, a gentleman in the Civil Service, Mr. 
George Udney, offered Carey the superintendence of an indigo 
factory of his own at Mudnabutty, where he hoped both to obtain a
maintenance, and to have great opportunities of teaching the 
natives in his employment.</p>
<p>Disaster as usual followed him: the spot was unhealthy, the 
family had fevers, one of the children died, and the mother lost 
her reason from grief, so that she had to be kept under restraint
for the rest of her life.&nbsp; Nor was Carey a better 
indigo-planter than a shoe-maker; the profits of the factory 
dwindled, and the buildings fell into ruin; the seasons were bad,
and in three years Mr. Udney found himself obliged to give up the
speculation; but in the meantime, though Carey had not been able 
to produce much effect on the natives, he had completed the 
preparation of the implement to which he most trusted for his 
work, a translation of the New Testament; and, moreover, had been
presented by good Mr. Udney with a wooden printing-press <!-- 
page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
103</span>with Bengalee type.&nbsp; The wonderful-looking thing 
was set up in one of the side rooms at the factory, and was 
supposed by the natives to be the idol of the Europeans!</p>
<p>In the meantime he opened a school, and preached to the 
natives in all the villages round, but without making much, if 
any, impression; indeed he was so disheartened, that he did not 
even teach his own children.&nbsp; The chief benefit of his 
residence in India was at present the example he set, and the 
letters he sent home, which bore in on the minds of others the 
necessities of their brethren in the East, and brought aid in 
subscriptions and, what was still more needed, men.</p>
<p>In 1799, four members of the Baptist communion offered 
themselves to go out as missionaries to India, and two of these 
were men who left most important traces behind them: William 
Ward, who had been a printer and editor of a newspaper at Derby, 
and had seen Mr. Carey before his going out to India, and Joshua 
Marshman.&nbsp; This latter was the person who, above all others,
gave the struggling mission the strength, consistency, and 
prudence which it wanted.&nbsp; The descendant of an old Puritan 
officer on the one side, and of Huguenot refugees on the other, 
he was brought up in strict Baptist principles by his father, who
was one of the cloth weavers then inhabiting Wiltshire in great 
numbers.&nbsp; As a child, he was passionately fond of reading, 
and his huge appetite for books and great memory made him a 
wonder in his village.&nbsp; A London bookseller, who was 
visiting the place, heard of this clever lad, and took him into 
his shop as an errand boy; but Joshua found that his concern was 
more with the outside of books than the inside, and came home, at
the end of five months, to his father&rsquo;s loom.</p>
<p>He was a steady lad, with no passions save for reading and 
quiet heartfelt religion; but though he had never been guilty of 
any serious fault, the Baptist body to which his family belonged 
considered he had too much &ldquo;head-knowledge&rdquo; of 
Christianity to have much &ldquo;heart-knowledge&rdquo; of its 
truths; and for that reason only, and their distrust and contempt
of human learning, refused to admit him to baptism.</p>
<p>However, this was no obstacle either to his marrying the 
daughter of a minister of his own persuasion, or taking the 
mastership of a school at Bristol, where he found less 
narrow-minded co-religionists, and was baptized by them in 1734, 
when twenty-six years of age.&nbsp; He was a successful 
schoolmaster, <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>and was likewise able to join the 
classes at Bristol Academy, where he studied thoroughly Latin, 
Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac.&nbsp; His circumstances were 
prosperous and rapidly improving when, after five years of great 
comfort at Bristol, his mind became so imbued with the sense of 
the need that some one should assist Carey, that he offered 
himself, together with Ward and two other young men, one of whom 
he had recently brought back to Christianity from Tom 
Paine&rsquo;s infidel doctrines.&nbsp; Again his &ldquo;human 
learning&rdquo; stood in his way.&nbsp; The honest, ignorant men 
who were working so earnestly, fancied it connected with 
Pharisaism, and had little idea that the Brahmin philosophy was 
as hard to deal with as the Greek.&nbsp; They accepted him, but 
with hesitation, and a passage for the whole party, including 
wives and children, was taken in an American vessel.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Grant advised them not to attempt to land at 
Calcutta, where they would probably be at once arrested and sent 
home again, but to land at the Danish colony of Serampore, and 
there wait for an opportunity of joining Carey at Mudnabutty.</p>
<p>Serampore is on the Hooghly, sixteen miles above Calcutta, and
here they found themselves on the 13th of October, 1799, in a 
town pleasantly situated, beautiful to look at, and full of a 
mixed population of Danes, Dutch, English, and natives of all 
hues.&nbsp; They were preparing to set forth for Mudnabutty when,
on the fifth day after their arrival, they were informed that the
British Government demanded that they should be immediately 
re-embarked and sent home again, whilst a local English paper, 
having never heard of Baptists, concluded that the word was a 
mistake for Papists, and announced the arrival of four Popish 
priests, emissaries of Buonaparte.&nbsp; The Danish governor, 
Colonel Bie, was resolved to stand his ground and not deliver 
them up; but they were prevented from setting foot upon the 
Company&rsquo;s territory, and the unwholesome, damp, little 
house that they were obliged to take while waiting at Serampore 
proved fatal to one of their number, the young man whom Marshman 
had rescued from infidelity, who died of chill and fever before 
his inexperienced associates were aware of his danger.</p>
<p>Another difficulty in the way of joining Carey and assisting 
in the printing of his translations, was that papers which were 
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
105</span>thought dangerous to the British power had lately been 
issued, and the Marquis Wellesley, who was then in the midst of 
his great war with Tippoo Sahib, was resolved not to allow any 
printing to be carried on except in Calcutta, where it could be 
under the eye of his officials.&nbsp; However, he had no 
objection to the establishment of mission, school, or press on 
the Danish ground, and Colonel Bie was only desirous to keep them
there; so it was decided to send Ward alone, with a Danish 
passport, to visit Carey at Mudnabutty, and confer with him upon 
his removal to Serampore, and the establishment of a mission 
settlement there.</p>
<p>All doubt was removed, while this consultation was in 
progress, by finding that the jealous Anglo-Indians were prepared
to arrest any missionary whom they caught upon their ground; and 
Carey&rsquo;s five years&rsquo; covenant as an indigo planter 
being now run out, his supposed idol was taken down and packed 
up, and his four boys and poor insane wife removed to Serampore, 
where all their present capital was laid out in the purchase of a
piece of ground and the construction of the habitations of the 
little colony.&nbsp; The expenses were to be defrayed from a 
common stock, each missionary in turn superintending the domestic
arrangements for a month, all the household dining together at 
one table, and only a small allowance being made to each head of 
a family for pocket money.</p>
<p>Six families were here united, and only 200<i>l.</i> was left 
to support them for the six months until remittances could be 
obtained from England; but all were used to cottage fare, and 
were not so dependent on servants as most Europeans in 
India.&nbsp; A piece of land attached to the house became, under 
Mr. Carey&rsquo;s care, a beautiful botanic garden.&nbsp; The 
press was set up under the care of Ward, and on the 18th of 
March, 1800, the first sheets of the Gospels in Bengalee were 
struck off.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Marshman opened two boarding 
schools for European children for the maintenance of the mission,
and their great ability in tuition rendered these so profitable 
as to become its main support.&nbsp; This was soon followed by 
another school for the natives, to which they eagerly 
thronged.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the missionaries went out, singly or in pairs, into 
the streets or the neighbourhood of the heathen temples, and 
attracted a crowd by singing hymns in Bengalee, and then <!-- 
page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
106</span>preached to them, offering to receive any inquiries at 
the mission-house.&nbsp; Carey&rsquo;s time was almost entirely 
taken up in hearing and answering these questions; but, as usual,
the ties of family, society, and custom almost always proved too 
strong to be broken through even by the conviction of the truth 
of Christianity.&nbsp; Ram-bosoo, Mr. Carey&rsquo;s first Hindoo 
friend, was like Serfojee, ready to do anything on behalf of 
Christianity except to embrace it openly himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas had meantime engaged himself as superintendent of a
sugar factory at Beerbhoom, whence he came to visit his brethren 
at Serampore, bringing with him one of his workmen named Fukier, 
whom he believed that he had converted.&nbsp; The man gave so 
good an account of his faith that the missionaries deemed him fit
for baptism, and rejoiced in him as the first-fruits of seven 
years&rsquo; labour; but he went home to take leave of his 
friends, and either they prevailed on him to give up his 
intention, or privately murdered him, for he never was heard of 
again.</p>
<p>However, a carpenter of Serampore named Krishnu, who had been 
brought into the mission-house with a dislocated arm for Mr. 
Thomas to set, was so struck by what he heard there that he, with
his wife and daughter and his brother Goluk, were all willing to 
give up their caste and be baptized.</p>
<p>There was much, however, to render the joy of this day far 
from being unmixed.&nbsp; Poor John Thomas, after his seventeen 
years of effort, fitful, indeed, but sincere, was so overjoyed at
this confession of faith that he became frantic, and in three 
days was raving violently.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the native mob, 
infuriated by hearing that Krishnu and Goluk had renounced their 
caste, rose to the number of two thousand, and dragged them to 
the magistrate, but found nothing to accuse them of.&nbsp; The 
magistrate released them, but they were brought back immediately 
after, on the plea that the person to whom Krishnu&rsquo;s 
daughter had been betrothed had a claim upon her.&nbsp; This, 
however, the authorities disallowed, and they even gave the 
missionaries a guard to secure them from any interruption during 
the rite of Baptism, which, by the customs of their sect, was 
necessarily in public, and by immersion; but there was serious 
consultation whether it were fit to use the Ganges, so 
superstitiously adored by the natives, for the purpose.&nbsp; 
Some argued that the Hindoos might think that the sacredness of 
Gunga was thus recognized, <!-- page 107--><a 
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>others that
they would consider that the Christians had defiled it, and it 
was finally resolved to use it like any other stream.&nbsp; In 
the meantime, Goluk and the two women had been so much terrified 
that they would not come forward; and on the day of the baptism, 
Sunday, the 26th of December, 1800, the only two candidates were 
Krishnu and Felix Carey, the missionary&rsquo;s own eldest 
son.&nbsp; William Carey walked from the chapel to the ghat, or 
steps leading to the river, with his son on one side and the 
Hindoo on the other; but the court they had to pass resounded 
with the frightful imprecations of poor Mr. Thomas in one room, 
echoed by screams from Mrs. Carey in the other.</p>
<p>At the gh&acirc;t the Danish governor himself, together with 
several of his countrymen, some Englishmen, a large body of 
Portuguese, and a throng of natives, Hindoo and Mahometan, were 
waiting, and before all these the baptism was performed by Mr. 
Carey.&nbsp; All were silent as if overawed, and Colonel Bie even
shed tears.</p>
<p>The next day there was not a scholar in the native school, but
the love of learning soon filled it again.&nbsp; Even down till 
quite recently, when the bands of attachment to the old 
heathenism have become much loosened, every open conversion 
continued to empty the schools, though never for long at a 
time.</p>
<p>The women soon recovered from their alarm and were baptized, 
and the mission also gained over an influential Portuguese 
gentleman named Fernandez, whom their tenets led them to view as 
in as much need of conversion as the heathen.&nbsp; He proved an 
active assistant, and for full thirty years laboured in their 
cause.</p>
<p>In the meantime Lord Wellesley had been engaged in founding 
the college at Fort William, Calcutta, for the training of young 
Europeans for the civil service in the knowledge of the numerous 
native tongues, laws, and customs with which they had to 
deal&mdash;and which are as various as they are 
important&mdash;not only practically, but philosophically.&nbsp; 
The only person at that time in Bengal qualified to teach the 
Bengalese language was the Northamptonshire cobbler, who had 
acquired it for the love of God and the spread of Gospel 
light!</p>
<p>His dissent was a disqualification for any of the higher 
offices of the college, but the teachership was offered to him, 
with a salary of 500 rupees a month&mdash;absolute affluence 
compared with his original condition.&nbsp; Yet he would not 
accept the post <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>unless he were allowed still to be 
regarded as a missionary.&nbsp; No objection was made, and thus 
by his talent and usefulness had Carey forced from the Government
which had forbidden him to set foot on their territories his 
recognition in the character he had always claimed.&nbsp; Even 
his private secular earnings he never regarded as his own: this 
income, and that arising from Marshman&rsquo;s school, these good
men viewed as rendering their mission from henceforth 
independent, and setting free the Society at home to support 
fresh ones.&nbsp; Already the accounts they sent home were 
stirring up many more subscribers, and the commendations bestowed
on them in the periodical accounts pained their humility.&nbsp; 
Ward wrote that it was like a public show: &ldquo;Very fine 
missionaries to be seen here!&nbsp; Walk in, brethren and 
sisters, walk in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was happy for the missionaries that their ground had thus 
been won, for the war with Denmark occasioned Serampore to be 
occupied by British troops early in 1801, and this would, earlier
in their career, infallibly have led to their expulsion: but, as 
it was, they were allowed to proceed exactly as they had done 
before.</p>
<p>Their most serious difficulties were at an end before poor 
Thomas, though he had recovered from his brain fever, died of an 
attack of fever and ague, after having done almost an equal 
amount of good and harm to his cause by his excitable nature and 
entire want of balance.&nbsp; Converts continued from time to 
time to be gathered in: Goluk took courage after waiting about 
two years, and a Brahmin named Krishnu-prisad trampled on his 
brahminical cord or poita, and was baptized.&nbsp; He was allowed
to wear it as a mark of distinction, but he gave it up 
voluntarily after three years.&nbsp; Moreover he broke through 
Indian prejudice by marrying the daughter of Krishnu, the first 
convert, though of a caste far inferior to his own.&nbsp; This 
was the occasion of a happy little wedding feast, given under a 
tree in front of the house of the bride&rsquo;s father, when a 
hymn composed by Krishnu was sung, and native dishes served up in
Eastern style, after which the entertainment concluded with 
prayer.&nbsp; Only the next week, in contrast to the devotion 
that blessed these family ties, three Hindoo widows were burnt on
a pile not far from the mission-house!</p>
<p>In still greater contrast was the first funeral among the 
converts of the mission-house&mdash;that of a man named 
Gokool.&nbsp; <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>The native custom is that the dead 
are always carried to burial by persons of their own caste, and 
it is intense defilement for one of another caste to touch the 
body.&nbsp; Christians were always carried by the lowest class of
the Portuguese, who had fallen into so degraded a state that they
were usually known by their own word for poor, 
&ldquo;pobre,&rdquo; and were despised by the whole 
population.&nbsp; They were generally drunk and disorderly, and 
their rudeness, irreverence, and quarrels were a scandal to the 
solemn occasion.&nbsp; Mr. Marshman, who was in charge of the 
mission at the time in Mr. Carey&rsquo;s absence, had some 
difficulty in persuading the Hindoo converts that it was no 
shame, but a charitable work, to bear a brother&rsquo;s body to 
its last resting-place, even though they were seen doing the work
of the despised pobres.&nbsp; Accordingly he resolved to set the 
example, and the corpse of the convert, within a coffin covered 
with white muslin, was carried to the burial-ground by Marshman, 
Felix Carey, a baptized Brahmin, and a baptized Hindoo, all the 
procession singing a Bengalee Christian hymn.</p>
<p>The most remarkable events that befell the Serampore Mission 
from this time were either domestic, or related to their 
connection with the College at Fort William, and the sanction 
they received from Government.&nbsp; Lord Wellesley went home in 
1805, Colonel Bie died the same year, and these were most serious
losses to the cause of the Serampore mission.&nbsp; Lord 
Wellesley had followed his own judgment, and carried things with 
a high hand, often against the will of the East India Company, 
and there was a strong desire to reverse his policy.&nbsp; His 
successor, Lord Cornwallis, died two months after landing, and 
Sir George Barlow, who carried on the government in the 
interregnum, though a good man, had not force enough to withstand
the dislike of the Anglo-Indians to the mission.&nbsp; Mr. Ward 
made an attempt at Calcutta to preach in Hindoo in a chapel, the 
ground of which had been purchased by the missionaries, but as he
walked through the streets the people shouted, 
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Hindoo padre; why dost thou destroy the 
caste of the people?&rdquo;&nbsp; And when, two Sundays later, a 
preacher of Brahmin birth appeared, there were loud cries of 
indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;O vagabond,&rdquo; cried one man, 
&ldquo;why didst thou not come to my house?&nbsp; I would have 
given thee a handful of rice rather than that thou shouldst have 
become a Feringhee!&rdquo;&nbsp; In spite of these cries, 
however, the chapel was thronged, until, <!-- page 110--><a 
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>after the 
third Sunday, when an order came forth from the magistrates, 
forbidding the missionaries either to preach, allow their 
converts to preach, distribute tracts, or even argue with the 
natives&mdash;or in anyway &ldquo;interfere with their 
prejudices&rdquo;&mdash;in Calcutta; and two new missionaries, 
named Chater and Robinson, who had come out without a licence, 
were prohibited from proceeding to Serampore.</p>
<p>Considering that these orders emanated only from a Provisional
Government during an interregnum, and that there was every hope 
that they might be reversed by the next Governor-General, the 
missionaries resolved to submit to them for the time, and to 
abstain from working in Calcutta.&nbsp; Early in the year 1806, 
however, the animosity of the English East Indians was increased 
by a mutiny that broke out among the Sepoys at Vellore, in the 
Madras Presidency, in consequence of some regulations as to their
dress, which they resented as being supposed to assimilate them 
to Europeans.&nbsp; The English colonel and all his garrison were
massacred, and, though the mutineers were surrounded and 
destroyed, great alarm prevailed.&nbsp; The discontent of the 
Sepoys was attributed to their displeasure at the spread of 
Christianity, and it was even averred that the lives of the 
English in India could only be preserved by the recall of all the
missionaries!</p>
<p>At Calcutta, Sir George Barlow sent to forbid Mr. Carey and 
his colleagues from making any further attempts at conversion, 
and for a short time they were entirely restricted to the Danish 
territory, while Chater and Robinson were ordered to embark for 
England, and were only kept by their appeal to the flag of 
Denmark.</p>
<p>Upon this Mr. Chater proceeded to Rangoon, an independent 
province, but on the whole the current of opposition was 
diminishing.&nbsp; Lord Wellesley and Mr. Pitt had prevailed upon
Government not to permit the College at Fort William to be broken
up, though it was reduced and remodelled.&nbsp; Mr. Carey was a 
gainer by the change, for he was promoted to a professorship, 
with an increase of salary, which he said was &ldquo;very good 
for the mission.&rdquo;&nbsp; He soon after received the diploma 
of a Doctor of Divinity from an American University.</p>
<p>The head-quarters of the establishment continued to be at 
Serampore, where the missionaries and their families still lived 
in common, supported upon the proceeds of Mr. Carey&rsquo;s 
professorship, <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Mr. Marshman&rsquo;s school, and 
likewise the subscriptions received from England.&nbsp; Here were
their chapel, their schools, and their printing-press, from 
whence emanated such books and tracts in Bengalee as could be 
useful for their purpose, and likewise their great work, the 
translation of the Scriptures, which Marshman and Carey were 
continually revising and improving as their knowledge of the 
language became more critical.&nbsp; Thence Mr. Carey went to 
give instruction at Fort William, and thence the preachers, as 
the opposition relaxed, went forth on expeditions into the 
country to teach, argue, and persuade, without any very 
wide-spread success, but still every year gaining a few 
converts&mdash;sometimes as many as twenty&mdash;who, when they 
had given sufficient evidence of faith, were always publicly 
baptized by immersion, according to the custom of the sect, which
indeed acknowledged no other form as valid, and re-baptized such 
members of other communions as joined them.&nbsp; Every 
missionary to the East Indies, whether belonging to their own 
society or not, was certain to visit and hold council with them, 
as the veterans of the Christian army in India, and the men most 
experienced in the character and language of the natives; they 
were the prime leaders and authorities in all that concerned the 
various vernacular translations of the Scriptures, and their 
example was as a trumpet-call to others to follow them in their 
labours; while all the time the simplicity, humility, 
self-denial, and activity of the men themselves remained 
unspoiled.</p>
<p>Wonderful, too, had been the effect produced by the stirring 
of the sluggish waters of indifference.&nbsp; The Society that 
had been with such difficulty established at home, was numbering 
multitudes of subscribers both in England and America; it had 
awakened a like spirit in other sects, and whereas no dissenting 
minister in London had at first taken up Carey&rsquo;s cause, it 
had become a scandal for a minister not to subscribe to or 
promote missions to the heathen.&nbsp; Missionary reports were 
everywhere distributed, young men aspired to the work, and 
American Universities did honour to the ability and scholarship 
of the pioneers of Serampore.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carey died on the 7th of December, 1807, having spent 
twelve years in a state of constant melancholy and often raving 
insanity.&nbsp; Poor woman! she was from the first a victim to 
her husband&rsquo;s aspirations, which she never 
understood.&nbsp; There is <!-- page 112--><a 
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>something 
piteous in the cobbler&rsquo;s daughter marrying the apprentice 
to keep on the business, and finding him a genius and a hero on 
her hands, starving, being laughed at, and at last carried off to
a strange land and fatal climate, all without the least 
comprehension or sympathy for the cause, and her mind failing 
before the material prosperity came, which she might have 
regarded as compensation.</p>
<p>In 1807, when some progress had been made, the grant for the 
translation of the Scriptures was withdrawn; but the 
superintendents resolved to persevere on their own account, and 
at the same time to collect all the information in their power 
respecting the Christians in India, so as to be able to rouse the
cold hearts at home to the perception that a real work was in 
progress.&nbsp; For this purpose, Dr. Claudius Buchanan, the 
Provost of the College at Fort William, made an expedition of 
inquiry among the various Christians, and his little book, 
&ldquo;Christian Researches,&rdquo; brought much before the 
public at home, of which they had hitherto been ignorant.</p>
<p>Before his time the enormities of the worship of Jaghernauth, 
and the horrors of the car, beneath which human victims threw 
themselves, had hardly been realized; and his very effective 
style of writing brought into full prominence the atrocities of 
the Suttee, or burning of widows on the funeral pile, a custom 
with which it was supposed to be impossible to interfere, but 
which has been proved to be entirely a corrupt practice, 
unsanctioned by any ancient law, only encouraged by the Brahmins 
out of avarice.&nbsp; Happily the present generation only knows 
of these atrocities as almost proverbial expressions, but when 
the century came in they were in full force.</p>
<p>It was Buchanan, too, who first revealed to the English the 
existence of those Nestorian Christians of St. Thomas, on the 
coast of Malabar, who had probably had no ecclesiastical 
intercourse with this country since the embassy of King Alfred, 
nine hundred years before.&nbsp; He also brought into public 
notice the effect of Swartz&rsquo;s labours, by describing a 
visit that he made to Tanjore, where he had a most kind reception
from Serfojee, and greatly admired the numerous charitable 
foundations of that beneficent Rajah.&nbsp; He also heard the 
services held in three languages in Swartz&rsquo;s church, and 
was greatly struck, when the Tamul sermon began, by hearing a 
universal scratching and grating all round him.&nbsp; This was 
caused, he <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>found, by the iron pens upon the 
palmyra leaves upon which most of the native congregation were 
taking notes, writing nearly as fast as the minister spoke.&nbsp;
He also heard Sattianadem&mdash;now a white-haired old 
man&mdash;preach on the &ldquo;Marvellous Light,&rdquo; and he 
felt that a great man had verily left his impress on these 
districts.</p>
<p>Carey&rsquo;s second marriage was curiously different from his
first.&nbsp; It was to a lady named Charlotte Rumohr, of noble 
extraction, belonging to a family of high rank, in the duchy of 
Schleswig.&nbsp; She was small and slightly deformed, but of good
abilities; she had been highly educated, and being generally a 
prisoner on a couch, she had read deeply in many languages.&nbsp;
She had come out to India in search of a warm climate, and 
residing at Serampore, had fallen under the influence of the 
missionaries, and had some years previously been admitted to 
their congregation by immersion.&nbsp; For the first time, Dr. 
Carey now enjoyed a really happy home, with a lady equal to 
conversing with him after the labours of the day.</p>
<p>But this mission, though subsisting for some years longer, 
hardly affords many more events.&nbsp; It was not without 
troubles.&nbsp; At times came friendly support; at others, 
opposition from the authorities&mdash;the committee at home were 
sometimes ignorantly meddlesome, sometimes sordid in their fits 
of economy; insufficiently tested fellow-labourers came out and 
failed; promising converts fell away; the climate was one steady 
unrelaxing foe, which took victims out of every family: but all 
these things were as the dust of the highway, trials common to 
man, and only incident to the very position that had been so 
wondrously achieved, since the day when the poor Baptist cobbler 
was so peremptorily silenced for but venturing to hint at the 
duty of converting the heathen.</p>
<p>Lord Hastings&rsquo; government was far more friendly than any
previous one, and the few notable events that befell the 
community are quickly numbered.&nbsp; In 1821, they were visited 
by Swartz&rsquo;s pupil, Serfojee, who was staying with the 
Governor-General, Lord Hastings, on his way to Benares, whither, 
strange and sad to say, he was on pilgrimage, though all the time
showing full intellectual understanding of, and warm external 
affection for, the Christian faith.&nbsp; He talked English 
easily, and showed much interest in all that was going on, but a 
heathen he still remained.</p>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>This visit only preceded by a few weeks the death of 
Mrs. Carey, after thirteen years&rsquo; marriage, the happiest of
Dr. Carey&rsquo;s life; but in another year he married a widow of
forty-five, who was ready to nurse his now declining years.&nbsp;
That year 1822 was a year of much sorrow; the cholera, said to 
have first appeared in 1817, became very virulent.&nbsp; The 
Hindoos viewed it as a visitation from the goddess of 
destruction, and held services to propitiate it, and when that 
had passed away, a more than usually fatal form of fever set 
in.&nbsp; Krishnu-pal, the first convert, who had for twenty 
years been a consistent Christian, was one of the first to be 
taken away.&nbsp; Dr. Carey himself, though exceedingly ill, 
recovered his former state of health, and continued his arduous 
labours, he being by this time the ablest philologist in India; 
but the little band had come to the time of life when &ldquo;the 
clouds return after the rain,&rdquo; and in 1823 Mr. Ward died of
cholera.&nbsp; For twenty-three years had the threefold cord 
between Carey, Marshman, and Ward, been unbroken.&nbsp; They had 
lived together like brothers, alike in aim and purposes, each 
supplying what the other lacked; and the distress of the parting 
was terrible, especially to Dr. Marshman, who at the time of his 
friend&rsquo;s illness was suffering from an attack of deafness, 
temporary indeed, but for some days total, so that he could only 
watch the final struggle without hearing a single word.</p>
<p>He wrote as if he longed to be with those whose toils and 
sorrows were at an end, but he still had much more to do.&nbsp; 
In 1826, he visited England, partly for the sake of pleading with
the Society at home, first begun on so small a scale by Carey, 
but which now numbered many members and disposed of large 
sums.&nbsp; The committee, however, were often hard to deal 
with.&nbsp; There were among them many men of good intentions, 
but without breadth of views, and used to small economies.&nbsp; 
They listened to false reports, censured without sufficient 
information, pinched their missions, and dictated the management,
so that to deal with them was but a vexation of spirit.&nbsp; 
Indeed, such annoyances are inseparable from the very fact of the
supplies and the government being in the hands of a body at a 
distance from the scene of action, and destitute of personal 
experience of the needs.</p>
<p>After much argument, the matter ended in the Serampore mission
being separated from the General Society, as indeed it <!-- page 
115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
115</span>had become nearly self-supporting through the numerous 
schools which the talents of the members of it had been able to 
establish.&nbsp; It was an unfortunate time, however, when the 
two men whose abilities had earned their present position were so
far past the prime of life; and, in 1830, the failure of a great 
banking company both deprived them of a large part of their 
investments, and, by ruining numerous families, lessened the 
attendance at Dr. Marshman&rsquo;s school.&nbsp; Moreover, the 
American subscribers sent a most vexatious and absurd 
remonstrance against any part of their contributions for training
young men to the ministry, being employed in teaching 
science.&nbsp; &ldquo;As if,&rdquo; said Dr. Marshman, 
&ldquo;youths in America could be educated for ministers without 
learning science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another disaster was that, on Lord William Bentinck&rsquo;s 
arrival in India in 1830, the finances of the Government were 
found to be in so unsatisfactory a state, that salaries were 
everywhere reduced, and that which Dr. Carey had derived from the
college at Fort William was thus cut down from 1,000 rupees per 
month to 500.&nbsp; At this time, the missions and preachers 
dependent on Serampore required 1,500<i>l.</i> a year for their 
support, and only 900<i>l.</i> was to be had, and this when both 
Marshman and Carey were seventy years of age, and still were 
toiling as hard as ever.</p>
<p>There were other troubles, too, as to who was the owner of the
buildings, whether the Baptist Society, or the missionaries as 
trustees, and as having paid a large portion of the price.&nbsp; 
A great inundation of the Hooghly had nearly settled the question
by washing the whole away.&nbsp; As it was, it did much damage, 
and destroyed the beautiful botanical garden that had for twenty 
years been Dr. Carey&rsquo;s delight.&nbsp; Finally the whole of 
the right of Marshman and Carey to the buildings was sold to the 
Society, for a much less amount than they had paid from their own
pockets; but they were to occupy them rent free for the rest of 
their lives.</p>
<p>The trouble and anxiety consequent on this question, which had
been of many years&rsquo; standing, had greatly impaired Dr. 
Marshman&rsquo;s strength both of body and mind.&nbsp; Morbid 
attacks of depression came on, during which he wandered about, 
unable to apply himself so much as even to write a letter, though
in the intervals he was both cheerful and full of activity.&nbsp;
Dr. Carey&rsquo;s health was likewise failing, and, with no 
formed illness, <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>he gradually sank, and died on the 
9th of June, 1834, in his seventy-third year.</p>
<p>To him belongs the honour of the awakening of the missionary 
spirit in England.&nbsp; Yet, as an individual preacher and 
teacher, he does not seem to have had much power.&nbsp; His 
talent was for language and philology; his perfections were faith
and perseverance.&nbsp; In these he was a giant; in everything 
else, whether as a cobbler, schoolmaster, indigo-planter, nay, 
even as father of a family, he was a failure: but his steady, 
faithful purpose enabled him so to use that one talent as to make
him the pioneer and the support as well as the example of numbers
better qualified for the actual work than himself.</p>
<p>His loss left Dr. Marshman alone, and suffering from 
melancholy more and more, as well as much harassed by 
difficulties as to the resources, and by captious complaints from
home.&nbsp; In 1836, a great shock was given to his nerves by the
danger of his daughter.&nbsp; She was the wife of Lieutenant 
Henry Havelock, a young officer, who, deeply impressed by Dr. 
Marshman&rsquo;s piety, had joined his congregation, and who was 
destined to become in after years one of the most heroic and able
of the defenders of the British cause in India.&nbsp; During his 
absence, she and her three children had been left at Landour, 
when their bungalow caught fire in the middle of the night, and 
blazed up with a rapidity due to its light, dry materials.&nbsp; 
She rushed out with her baby in her arms, but in crossing the 
verandah tripped and fell, losing her hold of the child.&nbsp; 
She was dragged away by a faithful native servant, who likewise 
snatched out her two eldest boys, but the poor baby was lost in 
the flames, and she herself was so much injured and overwhelmed 
by the alarm and grief, that, when her husband arrived, her state
was almost hopeless, and he wrote a letter preparing her father 
to hear of her death.&nbsp; From some untoward accident, no more 
tidings reached Serampore for three days, and to spirits that had
already lost their balance the suspense was fatal.&nbsp; The aged
father wandered about the house in a purposeless manner, 
sometimes standing gazing along the road through the Venetian 
blinds, sometimes talking incoherently; and when at last the 
intelligence arrived that Mrs. Havelock was out of danger, though
his joy and thankfulness were ecstatic, the effects of these 
three days were irremediable; he was hardly ever seen to smile 
again, could take no part in the renewed discussions <!-- page 
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
117</span>with the Baptist Society, although his mind and memory 
were still clear.&nbsp; He died on the 5th of December, 1837, 
just as the Serampore mission had been re-united to the General 
Baptist mission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There had been but few men at Serampore, but they were 
all giants,&rdquo; was said of them by one of the dignitaries of 
the Church and assuredly it was a wonderful triumph, that a 
shoe-maker, a schoolmaster, and a printer should in thirty-eight 
years not only have aroused the missionary spirit in England, but
have, by their resolution and talent, established thirty-three 
stations for the preaching of Christianity in India; while at the
time of the death of the last survivor, forty-nine ministers were
in union with them, half of whom were natives of Hindostan, and 
around each of the elder stations was a fair proportion of 
converts.&nbsp; Still more amazingly, these self-educated men 
had, by their accurate knowledge and deep study, become most 
eminent authorities in matters of language and philology; and by 
their usefulness had actually compelled a prejudiced Government 
to depend on them for assistance, and thus to support the work 
for which alone they cared.&nbsp; Never were the words more 
completely fulfilled than in them, &ldquo;Seek ye first the 
kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall 
be added unto you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reverses that chequered their wonderful success were not 
the more interesting difficulties of wild country, or persecuting
heathen, but troubles with an obstructive Government, and with 
the Society at home, which endeavoured to rule them without 
understanding them.&nbsp; These vexations are inseparable from 
the conditions of Societies trying to govern from home instead of
letting the management be carried on by a head upon the spot.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; THE JUDSON FAMILY.</h2>
<p>We must turn to an important offshoot from the Serampore 
mission, which assumed extensive proportions and a character of 
its own, chiefly in consequence of American zeal.&nbsp; Here, be 
<!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
118</span>it observed, was the first ground attempted by modern 
missions (not Roman Catholic) which belonged to an independent 
sovereign.</p>
<p>The great Burmese Empire, roughly speaking, occupies the 
Eastern India peninsula, being separated from that of Hindostan 
by the Brahmapootra river.&nbsp; The mountainous formation of the
country, its indented coast, and numerous rivers render it 
fertile, and the hills contain many valuable metals and beautiful
precious stones.</p>
<p>The inhabitants are of the Mongolian race, short, stout, 
active, and brown, with a good deal of ingenuity in arts and 
manufactures, but not equal to the Chinese, their 
neighbours.&nbsp; Their language is monosyllabic, their religion 
Buddhist, their government a despotic empire, and at the time the
mission was entered upon they had had little intercourse with 
strangers, but their women were not secluded, were not wholly 
uneducated, and were treated with consideration.</p>
<p>Buddha is regarded as a manifestation of Vishnu&mdash;the 
Hindoos say, to delude his enemies; the Buddhists, to bring a new
revelation.&nbsp; Gautama was the almost deified being who spread
the knowledge of Buddhism, about 500 <span 
class="smcap">b.c.</span>&nbsp; In different countries the 
religion has assumed different forms, but it is nearly 
co-extensive with the Mongolian race, and the general features 
are the rejection of the Vedas and of most of the Hindoo myths, 
faith in the divinity of Buddha, and hope that the individual 
personality will be entirely absorbed in his essence, the human 
being lost in the Deity.&nbsp; Five laws of virtue must be 
observed, ten kinds of sin avoided; and the Buddhist expects that
transgressions will be punished by the transmigration of his soul
into some inferior creature, whence he will rise by successive 
stages into another trial as a man, and gradually improving by 
the help of contemplation, and of a sublime state of annihilation
of all self-consciousness, may become fit for his final 
absorption into the Godhead.&nbsp; There is an extensive 
priesthood, called Lamas, who live in a state of celibacy in 
dwellings not at all unlike monasteries; and, in effect, so much 
in their practices seems to parody the ceremonies of Christianity
that the Portuguese thought them invented by the devil for the 
very purpose.&nbsp; However, there is no doubt that Buddhism 
inculcates a much purer morality than the religion of Brahma, and
far higher aims.&nbsp; In Burmah, however, the idea of the <!-- 
page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
119</span>eternity of the Deity had evidently been lost, and 
Gautama had practically usurped the place that the higher 
Buddhists gave to Brahma.&nbsp; Indeed, though the true Buddhist 
system looks to the absorption in the Deity,&mdash;Nirvana, as it
is called,&mdash;the popular notion, as received in Burmah and 
corrupted by less refined minds, made it into what was either 
absolute nonentity or could not be distinguished from it, so that
the ordinary Burman&rsquo;s best hope for the future was of 
nothing but annihilation.</p>
<p>There was originally a Burman Empire, but it had become broken
up, and the territories of Ava, Pegu, and Siam were separated, 
though Ava claimed them all, and owned a semi-barbarous 
magnificent court, with many gradations of dignitaries, sending 
out Viceroys to the different provinces and towns.</p>
<p>When in 1807 strong opposition was made by Sir George 
Barlow&rsquo;s government to the landing of the two Baptist 
missionaries, Robinson and Chater, the former obtained 
forbearance on account of his wife&rsquo;s health, but the latter
was obliged to embark; and, rather than return to England, he 
chose a vessel bound for Rangoon, a city at the mouth of the 
river Irrawaddy, the nearest Burmese harbour.&nbsp; His was to be
a reconnoitring expedition to discover the condition of the 
Burmese Empire, the progress that Roman Catholic missions were 
making there, and the possibility of undertaking anything from 
the centre of Serampore.&nbsp; Another missionary, named Mardon, 
went with him.&nbsp; They were well received by the European 
merchants resident at Rangoon, and returned with an encouraging 
report.&nbsp; It was decided that the attempt should be made; and
as Mr. Mardon did not feel equal to the undertaking, fifteen days
were set apart as a time of private prayer for direction who 
should be chosen in his stead.</p>
<p>It was Felix Carey, then nearly twenty-two, who volunteered to
go with Mr. Chater, of whom he was very fond.&nbsp; His father 
was unwilling to send him, not only on account of his youth, but 
because he was very valuable in the printers&rsquo; work, and had
an unusual amount of acquaintance with Sanskrit and Bengalee, so 
that he could hardly be spared from the translations; but the 
majority of the council at Serampore were in favour of his going,
and after a long delay, in consequence of the danger British 
trading vessels were incurring from French privateers <!-- page 
120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
120</span>from the Isle of France, they set sail and arrived at 
Rangoon early in the year 1808.</p>
<p>There they built themselves a house, and obtained a good deal 
of favour from the gentleness and amiability of Mr. Chater, and 
from young Carey&rsquo;s usefulness.&nbsp; He had regularly 
studied medicine for some years in the hospital at Calcutta, and 
his skill was soon in great request, especially for vaccination, 
which he was the first to introduce.&nbsp; His real turn was, 
however, for philology, and he was delighted to discover that the
Pali, the sacred and learned language of Burmah, was really a 
variety of the Sanskrit, cut down into agreement with the 
Mongolian monosyllabic speech.&nbsp; He began, with the 
assistance of a pundit, to compile a grammar, and to make a rough
beginning of a translation of the Scripture, a work indeed in 
which the Serampore people were apt to be almost too precipitate,
not waiting for those refinements of knowledge which are needful 
in dealing with the shades of meaning of words of such intense 
importance and delicate significancy.&nbsp; But on their 
principles, they could do nothing without vernacular Bibles, and 
they had not that intense reverence and trained scholarly 
appreciation which made Martyn spend his life on the correctness 
of a single version, rather than send it forth with a flaw to 
give wrong impressions.</p>
<p>Neither does Felix Carey seem to have been a missionary in 
anything but that bent which is given by training and family 
impulse.&nbsp; He delighted in languages, but rather as an end 
than a means; and though he did what the guiding fathers at 
Serampore required of him, it was as a matter of course, not with
his whole heart.&nbsp; In the meantime, the fact of Mr. Chater 
being a married man occasioned difficulties.&nbsp; Like their 
kinsmen the Chinese, the Burmese much objected to the residence 
of foreign females within their bounds; and when Mr. Chater 
obtained leave to bring his wife, she was so forlorn that he was 
obliged to seek for another station, and, receiving an invitation
to Ceylon, left Felix alone, except for his marriage with a young
woman of European extraction, but born in Burmah.</p>
<p>Soon after a dispute arose between the British and Burmese 
governments, and two English ships of war appeared off 
Rangoon.&nbsp; The native authorities wished the young missionary
to act as interpreter, and on his refusal he was accused of being
a spy, and was forced to take refuge on board one of the British 
<!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
121</span>ships where he remained for two months before the 
differences were adjusted, and he was allowed to return on 
condition that he should not refuse his services as interpreter 
another time.&nbsp; In the October of 1812 he came home to 
Serampore to print his Burmese grammar and Gospel of St. Matthew,
and not only did this, but carried a press back with him to 
Rangoon.&nbsp; A youth who was sent from the congregation at 
Calcutta to co-operate with him proved unfit for the work, and 
was advised to return to secular business; but in the meantime, 
the person who was, above all others, to be identified with the 
Burmese mission, had heard the call and was on his way.</p>
<p>This was Adoniram Judson, a native of New England, the eldest 
son of the minister of Malden, in Massachusetts, born in 1788, 
and bred up first at a school near home, and afterwards at Brown 
University.&nbsp; His acuteness and cleverness from infancy were 
great, especially in arithmetic and mathematics.&nbsp; During his
studies, he met with a clever and brilliant friend who had 
imbibed the deistical teaching of the French Revolution, and 
infected him with it, and he came home at seventeen the winner of
all the honours and prizes that the College afforded, but 
announcing himself to his parents as a decided infidel!&nbsp; The
pastor treated him with stern displeasure, and argued hotly with 
him, but young Adoniram was the cleverer man, and felt his 
advantage.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s tears and entreaties were 
less easy to answer, and the thought of them dwelt with him, do 
what he would, when he set out on a sort of tour through the 
surrounding States.&nbsp; On his journey, he stopped at a country
inn, and was told, with much apology, that there was no choice 
but to give him a room next to that of a young man who was so ill
that he could scarcely live till morning.&nbsp; In fact, 
Adoniram&rsquo;s rest was broken by the groans of the dying man 
and the footsteps of the nurses, and there&mdash;close to the 
shadow of death&mdash;his infidelity, which had been but pride of
intellect and fashion, began to quail, as the thought of the 
future haunted him.&nbsp; Morning came; all was still.&nbsp; He 
asked after his fellow-lodger, and heard that he was dead.&nbsp; 
He asked his name.&nbsp; It was no other than the very youth who 
had staggered his faith.</p>
<p>The shock changed his whole tone.&nbsp; He could not bear to 
continue his journey, but turned back to Plymouth, determined to 
prove to himself what was indeed truth; and, while deeply <!-- 
page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
122</span>studying the evidences of Christianity, he supported 
himself by keeping a school and writing educational books on 
grammar and arithmetic.&nbsp; His mind was soon thoroughly made 
up, as, indeed, his aberrations had been only on the surface, and
he became very anxious to enter the Theological College at 
Andover, Massachusetts.&nbsp; This belonged to the most earnest 
of the Congregationalists, and evidence of personal conversion 
and piety was required from the candidates; but, in his case, the
professors were satisfied, and he entered on his course of study,
which included Hebrew.&nbsp; In the last year of his studies 
there he fell in with Claudius Buchanan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Star in 
the East,&rdquo; and the perusal directed his whole soul to the 
desire of missionary labour.&nbsp; His mind was harassed night 
and day with the thought of longing to do something for the 
enlightenment of the millions in Asia; and, meeting with 
Symes&rsquo; &ldquo;Burmese Empire,&rdquo; his thoughts turned 
especially in that direction.&nbsp; It was a quiet steady 
purpose, though he was slow of communicating it; until, one 
evening at home, his father began throwing out hopes and hints of
some great preferment, and his mother and sister smiled 
complacently, as if they were in the secret.&nbsp; Adoniram 
begged for an explanation, since it was possible their plans 
might not coincide, to which his father replied there was no 
fear, and told him that the minister of the biggest church in 
Boston wished for him as a colleague.&nbsp; &ldquo;So near 
home,&rdquo; said the delighted mother.&nbsp; He could not bear 
to answer her, but, when his sister chimed in, he turned to her, 
saying, &ldquo;No, sister, I shall never live in Boston; I have 
much farther to go;&rdquo; and then, steadily and calmly, but 
fervidly, he set forth the call that he felt to be upon 
him.&nbsp; How different a communication from that which he had 
made two years before!&nbsp; No doubt his family so felt it, for,
though his mother and sister shed many tears, neither they nor 
his father offered a word of opposition.</p>
<p>Thenceforth his fate was determined, and he began to prepare 
himself.&nbsp; He was, in person, slightly made and 
delicate-looking, with an aquiline face, dark eyes, and chesnut 
hair; and though his constitution must have been immensely strong
to have borne what he underwent, at this time he was thought 
delicate; and therefore, with his one purpose before him, he 
carefully studied physiology, and made himself a code of rules 
which he obeyed to the end of his life, in especial inhaling 
large <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>quantities of air, sponging the 
whole body with cold water, and taking daily exercise by 
walking.&nbsp; He was a man of great vivacity and acuteness, with
the poetical spirit that accompanies strong enthusiasm, and with 
a fastidious delicacy and refinement in all personal matters, 
such as seemed rather to mark him as destined to be an 
accomplished scholar than to lead the rude life of a missionary; 
and Ann Hasseltine, the young lady on whom he had fixed his 
affections, was a very beautiful girl, of great cultivation and 
accomplishments, but they were alike in one other great 
respect,&mdash;namely, in dauntless self-devotion.&nbsp; He began
to talk of his purpose to the like-minded among his college 
mates, and gradually gathered a few into a very small missionary 
association, into which none were admitted who had any duties 
that could forbid their going out to minister among the 
heathen.</p>
<p>At the same time, and partly through their means, a wider 
association was formed, which had its centre at Bradford, and 
which finally decided on sending Judson to England to endeavour 
to effect a union with the London Missionary Society, which had 
been formed in 1795, in imitation of Carey&rsquo;s Baptist 
Society, to work in other directions by Nonconformists of other 
denominations.</p>
<p>The voyage in 1811, in the height of the continental war, was 
a very perilous one.&nbsp; On the way the vessel was taken by the
French and carried into Bayonne, while the young American 
passenger was summarily thrown into the hold with the common 
sailors.&nbsp; He became very ill, but, when the French doctor 
visited him, he could hold no communication for want of a common 
language.&nbsp; Then it was that there came thoughts of home, and
of the &ldquo;biggest church in Boston,&rdquo; and a misgiving 
swept over him, which he treated at once as a suggestion of the 
enemy, and betook himself to prayer.&nbsp; Then, in the grey 
twilight of the hold, he felt about for his Hebrew Bible; and to 
keep his mind fully absorbed, began mentally rendering the Hebrew
into Latin.&nbsp; When the doctor came in, he took up the Bible, 
perceived that he had a scholar to deal with, began to talk Latin
to him, and arranged his release from the hold.</p>
<p>But on landing at Bayonne, he was marched through the streets 
as a prisoner with the English crew.&nbsp; He began declaiming in
his native language on the injustice of detaining an American, 
and obtained his purpose by attracting the attention <!-- page 
124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>of
an American gentleman in the street, who promised to do what he 
could for him, but advised him in the meantime to proceed 
quietly.&nbsp; The whole party were thrown into a dismal 
underground vault, and the stones covered with straw, which 
seemed to Judson so foul that he could not bear to sit down on 
it, and he walked up and down, though sick and giddy with the 
chill, close, noisome atmosphere.&nbsp; Before his walking powers
were exhausted, his American friend was at the door, and saying, 
&ldquo;Let me see whether I know any of these poor 
fellows,&rdquo; took up the lamp, looked at them, said &ldquo;No 
friend of mine,&rdquo; and as he put down the lamp threw his own 
large cloak round Mr. Judson, and grasping his arm, led him out 
under it in the dark; while a fee, put into the hand, first of 
the turnkey and then of the porter, may have secured that the 
four legs under the cloak should pass unobserved.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Now run,&rdquo; said the American, as soon as they were 
outside, and he rushed off to the wharf, closely followed by his 
young countryman, whom he placed on board a vessel from their own
country for the night.&nbsp; Afterwards, Judson&rsquo;s papers 
were laid before the authorities, and he was not only released, 
but allowed to travel through France to the northern coast, and, 
making friends with some of the Emperor&rsquo;s suite on the way 
home from Spain, travelled to Paris in an Imperial 
carriage.&nbsp; Afterwards, he made his way to England, where he 
received a warm welcome from the London Missionary Society, by 
which he and the three friends he had left in 
America&mdash;Samuel Newell, Samuel Nott, and Gordon 
Hall&mdash;were accepted as missionaries; but on Judson&rsquo;s 
return to America, he found that the Congregationalist Mission 
Board there was able to undertake their expenses, and accordingly
they went out, salaried by their own country.&nbsp; All four were
dedicated to the ministry at Salem on the 6th of February, 1812, 
and immediately prepared to sail for the East Indies.</p>
<p>Judson, with his wife, the beautiful dark-eyed Ann Hasseltine,
and his friends Mr. and Mrs. Newell, also newly married, embarked
in the <i>Caravan</i>; Hall, Nott, and another college mate, 
named Luther Rice, were in the <i>Harmony</i>.&nbsp; They were at
once received at Serampore, on their landing, in the June of 
1812, but Dr. Carey&rsquo;s expectations of them were not 
high.&nbsp; Adoniram and Ann Judson were both delicate, slender, 
refined-looking people.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have little hope from the 
Americans,&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;if they should stay in the 
East, American habits <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>are too luxurious for a preparation 
to live among savages.&rdquo;&nbsp; He little knew what were the 
capabilities of Ann Judson, the first woman who worked 
effectively in the cause, the first who rose above the level of 
being the comfort of her husband in his domestic moments, and was
an absolute and valuable influence.</p>
<p>The opposition to the arrival of missionaries was at its 
height, and this large batch so dismayed the Calcutta authorities
that, declaring them British subjects come round by America, they
required their instant re-embarkation.&nbsp; It was decided to go
to the Isle of France, whence it was hoped to find a French ship 
to take them to the aid of Felix Carey, but the first vessel 
could only take the Newells, and the detention at Serampore drew 
the Judsons and Rice into the full influence of Marshman&rsquo;s 
powerful and earnest mind.&nbsp; Aware that they would have to 
work with the Baptist mission, they had studied the tenets on the
voyage, but found when they arrived, that the points of 
difference were subjects that the trio at Serampore did not 
choose to discuss, lest their work among the heathen should 
suffer by attention to personal controversy.&nbsp; However, their
own thoughts and the influences of the place led them to desire 
baptism by immersion; and this being done, they considered it due
to the Congregationalists, who had sent them out, to resign their
claim on them for support, though this left them destitute.&nbsp;
It was decided that Rice should go home and appeal for their 
support to the American Baptists, and in this he thoroughly 
succeeded, while the Judsons, after sailing for Mauritius, where 
they found poor Mrs. Newell recently dead, made their way back to
Madras, and there found a vessel bound for Rangoon.&nbsp; It was 
a crazy old craft, with a Malay crew, no one but the captain able
to speak a word of English.&nbsp; The voyage was full of 
disaster.&nbsp; A good European nurse, who had been engaged to go
with Mrs. Judson, fell on the floor and died suddenly, even while
the ship was getting under weigh, too late to supply her 
place.&nbsp; Mrs. Judson became dangerously ill, and the vessel 
was driven into a perilous strait between the Great and Little 
Andaman Islands, where the captain was not only out of his 
bearings, but believed that, if he were driven ashore, the whole 
ship&rsquo;s company would be eaten by the cannibal 
islanders.&nbsp; The alarm, however, acted as a tonic, and Mrs. 
Judson began to recover.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>They reached Rangoon in safety, but Judson writes: 
&ldquo;We had never before seen a place where European influence 
had not contributed to smooth and soften the rough features of 
uncultivated nature.&nbsp; The prospect of Rangoon, as we 
approached, was quite disheartening.&nbsp; I went on shore, just 
at night, to take a view of the place and the mission-house, but 
so dark and cheerless and unpromising did all things appear, that
the evening of that day, after my return to the ship, we have 
marked as the most gloomy and distressing that we ever 
passed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mission-house was not quite empty, 
though Felix Carey, who they had hoped would welcome them, was at
Ava.&nbsp; When Mrs. Judson, still too weak to walk, was carried 
ashore, she was received by his wife, who could speak Burmese, 
and managed the household, providing daily dinners of fowls 
stewed with rice or with cucumber.</p>
<p>It was, however, a dismal place, near the spot where public 
executions took place, and where the dead were burnt outside the 
walls.&nbsp; And all around, among the beautiful vegetation and 
lovely forests on the banks of the broad Irrawaddy, rose the 
pagodas, graceful with the peculiar beauty of the far East, with 
gilded lacquer-work, umbrella-shaped roofs spiring upwards; huge 
idols with solemn contemplative faces within, and all around 
swarms of yellow-robed, fat, lazy lamas.</p>
<p>The new comers meantime applied themselves to the study of the
language, after overcoming the disdain of their pundit at having 
to instruct a woman.&nbsp; He could not speak English, and had 
neither grammar nor dictionary, so that the difficulties were 
great; but the eager spirit of the students overcame all, and 
they ventured to remove into town and keep house themselves.</p>
<p>Mrs. Judson was taken to visit the wives of the Myowoon, or 
Viceroy of Rangoon, by a French lady who had been admitted 
before.&nbsp; On their first arrival the principal wife was not 
up, and the ladies waited, while the inferior wives examined all 
they wore, and tried on their gloves and bonnets; but when the 
great lady appeared, they all crouched together at a 
distance.&nbsp; She came in richly attired, and smoking a silver 
pipe, and sat down on a mat by Mrs. Judson, whom she viewed with 
much curiosity, asking if she were her husband&rsquo;s first 
wife.&nbsp; The Myowoon came in looking wild and savage, and 
carrying a <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>huge spear in his hand; but he was 
very polite to Mrs. Judson, though he took very little notice of 
her husband.</p>
<p>In fact the government was violent and barbarous.&nbsp; There 
were perpetual murders and robberies, and these were punished by 
horrid executions, accompanied by torture; yet the Burmese 
regarded themselves as superior to all other nations, and were 
far from understanding how greatly they fell short even of the 
requirements of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Felix Carey, meantime, had been requested by the king to 
vaccinate the royal children; but he had to return to Calcutta to
procure matter for the purpose.&nbsp; He then visited Rangoon on 
his way back, and prepared to carry up his family, property, and 
printing-press to Ava, with the hope of forming a fresh station 
there, under royal patronage; but after ten days&rsquo; voyage, 
the vessel was capsized by a sudden storm, and all who could not 
swim were drowned.&nbsp; Felix tried to rescue his little son of 
three years old, but, finding himself sinking, he let the child 
go, and saved himself alone.</p>
<p>Everything in the vessel was lost; but the king gave him 
compensation for the property, and took him into high favour, 
sending him shortly after, to conduct some negotiations with the 
British Government.&nbsp; He appeared at Calcutta with the title 
and gorgeous dress of a Burmese noble, and showed himself in the 
streets with a train of fifty followers.&nbsp; Old Dr. Carey was 
seriously grieved at his thus &ldquo;sinking from a missionary to
an ambassador;&rdquo; and he was by no means successful in this 
new line; in fact his negotiations turned out so ill, that on his
return to Rangoon he was obliged to fly the country.&nbsp; The 
excitement of his life had made missionary labour distasteful to 
him, and, after strange wanderings in the wild lands eastward of 
Bengal, he became prime minister and generalissimo to a barbarous
prince; and in that capacity led an army against his old friends,
the Burmese, sustained a defeat, and was forced to wander in the 
jungle.&nbsp; After three years of this strange life, he fell in 
by chance at Chittagong with Mr. Ward, and was by him persuaded 
to return to the printing and philology, for which alone, like 
his father, he really was well qualified.&nbsp; He lived at 
Serampore till 1822, and then was carried off by the same sickly 
season that had proved fatal to Krishnu-pal, who had been 
baptized with him, and to Bishop Middleton.</p>
<p>Meantime, Mr. and Mrs. Judson were working steadily on, <!-- 
page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
128</span>and were greatly cheered by the arrival of a much less 
barbarous viceroy, named Mya-day-men.&nbsp; They were invited, 
with all the Europeans, to a banquet at the new official&rsquo;s 
house, and Mrs. Judson was entertained by the wife, who 
questioned her eagerly, and asked if she knew how to dance in the
English way; but was satisfied on hearing that the wives of 
priests did not dance.&nbsp; As Buddhist priests are celibate, 
Mrs. Judson must have been rather a puzzle to the good lady; and 
all this time the real work of the mission had not commenced, for
the preliminary operation of acquiring the language had not been 
completed, and Judson was warned not to attempt preaching till he
was familiar with it, by Dr. Carey having told him that after 
some years in Bengal, when he imagined himself to be freely able 
to use the language, he had found from the remark of a young man,
that he was really not in the least understood.&nbsp; Private 
arguments with the teachers was all that could be attempted, and 
in these there seems to have been some forgetfulness of St. 
Paul&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Who art thou that judgest 
another?&nbsp; To his own master he standeth or falleth;&rdquo; 
since there was a very free threatening that the souls of the 
pagans must be lost; to which the pundits replied with true 
Eastern calmness, &ldquo;Our religion is good for us, yours for 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; During this time of perseverance and 
preparation, Mrs. Judson&rsquo;s health became so much affected 
that she was forced to go to Madras.&nbsp; Heroine as she was, 
she would not consent to let her husband break up his work to 
accompany her; but the solitude of her absence fell on him most 
severely.&nbsp; She says, &ldquo;He had no individual Christian 
with whom he could converse or unite in prayer during the six 
months of her absence;&rdquo; but he worked on heartily, and she 
returned in perfect health.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1816, the death of their first-born child was
a great shock to the father&rsquo;s health, which was already 
disordered; and he continued in a declining state all through the
summer.&nbsp; The Myowoon&rsquo;s wife, whom Mrs. Judson 
conveniently calls the vice-reine, was very kind to them, and 
took them on elephant-back to visit her country-house.&nbsp; The 
way lay through the woods, between trees sometimes so thick that 
the elephants broke them down, at the mahout&rsquo;s word, to 
make way.&nbsp; Thirty men in red caps, with spears and guns, 
formed the guard; then came the vice-reine&rsquo;s elephant, with
a gilded howdah, where the lady sat dressed in red <!-- page 
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
129</span>and white silk; then the Judsons&rsquo; animal, three 
or four more behind with grandees, and 300 or 400 attendants 
followed.&nbsp; At a beautiful garden, full of fruit trees, a 
feast was spread under a noble banyan, the vice-reine causing the
cloth next to her to be allotted to her guests, whom she tended 
affectionately, gathering and paring fruit, cutting flowers and 
weaving them for them, and, unlike the Hindoos, freely eating 
what they handed her.&nbsp; This hospitable and amiable lady had 
just begun to ask Mrs. Judson the difference between the 
Christians&rsquo; God and Gautama, when she was obliged to return
to Ava.</p>
<p>For several months Mr. Judson&rsquo;s illness increased; but 
exercise on horseback did much to relieve him, and the comfort 
and encouragement of the arrival of a brother missionary, Mr. 
Hough, with his family, did more.&nbsp; He weathered the attack 
without leaving his post, and in 1817 made his first real 
step.&nbsp; A press had come out with Mr. Hough, and with it two 
little tracts, summarizing the chief truths of Christianity, were
printed and distributed at Rangoon.</p>
<p>Shortly after, a respectable-looking Burmese, attended by a 
servant, walked into Mr. Judson&rsquo;s house, and sat 
down.&nbsp; Presently he inquired, &ldquo;How long a time will it
take me to learn the religion of <span 
class="smcap">Jesus</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson answered, that where God gave light and wisdom, it 
was soon learnt; but without, a whole lifetime would not teach a 
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;came the wish 
for this knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen two little books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>?&rdquo; 
said the missionary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the Son of <span class="smcap">God</span>, who, 
pitying human creatures, came into this world and suffered death 
in their stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is <span class="smcap">God</span>?&rdquo; continued
Mr. Judson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a Being without beginning or end, who is not 
subject to old age or death, but always is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson showed him the two little books, which he 
recognized, but begged for more.&nbsp; He did not attend much to 
what Judson tried to teach him by word of mouth, but begged for 
book.&nbsp; The Gospel of St. Matthew was in hand, but could not 
be finished for three months; and when he was told this 
&ldquo;Have you not a little of that book done, which you will 
graciously give me now?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;And 
I,&rdquo; writes Judson, &ldquo;beginning to think that 
God&rsquo;s time was better than man&rsquo;s, <!-- page 130--><a 
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>folded and 
gave him the two first half-sheets, which contain the first five 
chapters of St. Matthew, on which he instantly rose, as if his 
business was done, and took leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was long before they saw him again; though many other 
persons began calling at the mission-house to inquire about what 
they called the new religion; but all were so much afraid of one 
another, that no one would ask any questions if a fellow-citizen 
were present.&nbsp; Mrs. Judson was also getting together from 
fifteen to twenty women every Sunday, whom she tried to 
instruct.&nbsp; One of them, like the Norseman of old, preferred 
casting in her lot with her forefathers to a heaven separated 
from them; and when Mrs. Judson told her they would reproach her 
with the rejection of the truth they had never known, and that 
she would regret her folly when it was too late, she answered, 
&ldquo;If I do, I will cry out to you to be my 
intercessor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another combined prayers to our Lord 
and Gautama.</p>
<p>The vice-reine came back from Ava, and continued to be very 
kind to Mrs. Judson, made her explain her doctrine, caused the 
little catechism to be taught to her daughter, and accepted a 
copy of the Gospel of St. Matthew, which was at length 
completed.&nbsp; This being finished, Mr. Judson, after four 
years&rsquo; study of the language, believed himself able to 
undertake more public ministrations; but first went on a voyage 
to Chittagong, where he hoped to find, among the Christian 
converts of Burmese speech, one to assist him in communicating 
with the people.</p>
<p>Mrs. Judson remained with the Houghs, and had the pleasure of 
receiving the Burmese inquirer, whose long absence had been 
occasioned by his being appointed governor of some villages in 
Pegu.&nbsp; He said he was thinking and reading in order to 
become a believer.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I cannot yet destroy my old 
mind, for, when I see a handsome patso, or a handsome gounboun, 
<a name="citation130"></a><a href="#footnote130" 
class="citation">[130]</a> I still desire it.&nbsp; Tell the 
great teacher, when he returns, that I wish to see him, though I 
am not a disciple of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gave him the rest 
of St. Matthew, and a tract to each of his attendants, and he 
promised that, if the great teacher would come and see him, he 
would collect his villagers to hear the new doctrine 
preached.&nbsp; There was something very attractive, meek, and 
unassuming about the man&rsquo;s whole appearance, and of him 
there was much hope; but, just about this <!-- page 131--><a 
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>time great 
anxiety fell on the mission party.&nbsp; The kindly Myowoon and 
his wife were removed, and immediately after a summons was sent 
to Mr. Hough to appear at the court-house of the city, with the 
intimation, &ldquo;that, if he did not tell the whole truth they 
would write it in his blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was kept all Friday 
and Saturday answering, through an interpreter, foolish 
questions: who were his father and mother, how many suits of 
clothes he had, and the like; all which was formally written 
down.&nbsp; On the third day, Sunday, Mrs. Judson, resolving to 
ascertain whether this were really done by the command of the 
Myowoon, drew up a petition, which she carried herself.&nbsp; She
was graciously received, and it presently appeared that an order 
had really been sent for the banishment of some Portuguese 
priests, and that the petty officials of the Court had taken 
advantage of it to harass Mr. Hough, in the hope of extracting a 
reward for his liberation.</p>
<p>At this time there was a terrible visitation of cholera, which
the Burmese attributed to evil spirits, and accordingly attempted
to drive away by force of noise.&nbsp; It was supposed that the 
evil spirits would take refuge in any house that was silent, and 
for three whole nights cannon were fired from the court-house, 
and every human creature used the utmost powers nature or art 
afforded for producing a din.&nbsp; The mission party were 
uninfected by the contagion, but it was a time of terrible 
anxiety, for nothing had been heard of Mr. Judson or his ship for
months; there were reports of ill-feeling between the Burmese and
British Governments, no arrivals of English at Rangoon, and no 
intelligence.&nbsp; Mrs. Judson&rsquo;s female classes had fallen
off ever since Mr. Hough&rsquo;s summons, and the state of things
was such, that the Houghs decided on removing to Bengal.&nbsp; 
Mrs. Judson, with her little girl, most reluctantly decided to 
accompany them, but, just as the vessel in which they sailed had 
gone down the river, she was ascertained not to be seaworthy; 
and, during this delay, Mrs. Judson&rsquo;s fears of her 
husband&rsquo;s finding her gone, if he ever returned to Rangoon,
so increased, that she went back with her child to the house, 
and, brave woman as she was, took up her abode there with the 
native servants, trusting herself wholly to the protection of her
God.&nbsp; She was rewarded by her husband&rsquo;s arrival, after
an absence of nine months, caused by the captain of his ship 
having broken his engagement, and carried him on <!-- page 
132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>to
Madras, where he had been detained all this time for want of a 
vessel to return in.&nbsp; The Houghs also came back, and two 
young men from America soon after came out, full of zeal and 
activity, but both fell ill very shortly afterwards, and the 
younger died, but his fellow, Mr. Colman, became a valuable 
assistant.</p>
<p>This era, the spring of 1819, was the first great step in the 
Burmese mission.&nbsp; Funds had been raised by the Baptist 
Society in America, which were applied to the erection of a zayat
or public room, with walls of bamboo and a thatched roof.&nbsp; 
It had two rooms, one for a school for the women, another for the
men, who gladly learnt to read and write from Mrs. Judson and a 
Burmese teacher.&nbsp; Here, too, Mr. Judson openly held prayers 
and preaching on Sunday, and these attracted many, some of whom 
would come in the week for private discussion.</p>
<p>The first real convert was a man of thirty-five, named Moung 
Nau, poor, but of excellent character, and so intelligent, that 
he became a useful assistant after his baptism, on the 27th of 
June, 1819.&nbsp; Others were inquiring, among whom the most 
interesting was Moung Shwaygnong, a schoolmaster or tutor by 
profession, at a village a little way from Rangoon, and already a
philosopher, &ldquo;half deist, half sceptic, the first of the 
sort I have seen among the Burmans&rdquo; (our quotations are 
from Mr. Judson&rsquo;s journal), who, however, worshipped at the
pagodas, and conformed to national observances.&nbsp; The second 
time he came the conversation seemed to have made &ldquo;no 
impression on his proud sceptical heart, yet he promised to pray 
to the eternal God, through the Saviour.&rdquo;&nbsp; It appeared
that, about eight years previously, it had come before him that 
there is indeed One Eternal God, and that this thought had been 
working in him ever since.&nbsp; A copy of Mr. Judson&rsquo;s 
tract which fell in his way chimed in with this primary belief, 
and next came the question of the Scripture revelation, which he 
argued over with much metaphysical power and acuteness, being a 
very powerful reasoner, and well trained in the literature of his
own country.&nbsp; Meantime three simpler minds&mdash;Moung 
Thaahlah, Moung Byaay, and Moung Ing&mdash;had been thoroughly 
convinced, and, though aware that they would expose themselves to
considerable danger, resolved to become Christians.</p>
<p>The Viceroy had remarked the zayat, and notice was taken <!-- 
page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
133</span>that men were there led &ldquo;to forsake the religion 
of the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The alarm cleared the zayat of all 
the audience, and emptied Mrs. Judson&rsquo;s class of women, but
Thaahlah <a name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133" 
class="citation">[133]</a> and Byaay sent in a letter, entreating
to be admitted to baptism, and Ing would have followed their 
example, but that his trade as a fisherman carried him off to 
sea.&nbsp; They begged not to be baptized openly, as Nau had 
been, in a piece of water near the town and presided over by an 
image of Gautama; and Mr. Judson yielded so far, that he 
conducted the preliminary devotions in the zayat, and baptized 
them in the same pool two hours after dark.&nbsp; Shwaygnong had 
in the meantime taken alarm at being interrogated by the 
Government, had apologized, and apparently fallen away; but he 
could not keep aloof, and soon came back again.&nbsp; After a 
good deal of fencing and putting forth metaphysical cavils, he 
allowed that it was all for the sake of experiment, and declared 
that he really believed both in God and in the Atonement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said I,&rdquo; writes Mr. Judson, &ldquo;knowing his 
deistical weakness, do you believe all that is contained in the 
book of St. Matthew which I gave you?&nbsp; In particular, do you
believe that the Son of God died on a cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;you have caught me 
now.&nbsp; I believe that He suffered death, but I cannot admit 
that He suffered the shameful death of the cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are not a disciple
of Christ.&nbsp; A true disciple inquires not whether a fact is 
agreeable to his own reason, but whether it is in the Book.&nbsp;
His pride has yielded to Divine testimony.&nbsp; Teacher, your 
pride is unbroken.&nbsp; Break down your pride, and yield to the 
Word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;As you utter these 
words,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I see my error.&nbsp; I have been 
trusting in my own reason, not in the Word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some interruption now occurred.&nbsp; When we were again 
alone, he said, &ldquo;This day is different from all the days on
which I have visited you.&nbsp; I see my error in trusting to my 
own reason, and I now believe the Crucifixion of Christ, because 
it is contained in the Scripture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The profession of Christianity had become more perilous since 
the Judsons&rsquo; arrival in Burmah.&nbsp; The old Emperor had 
<!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
134</span>died in 1819, and had been succeeded by his grandson, 
who was far more zealous for Buddhism than he had been, and who 
had appointed a viceroy at Rangoon, very minute in exacting 
observances&mdash;so much so, as to put forth an edict forbidding
any person with hat, shoes, umbrella, or horse, to pass through 
the grounds belonging to the great pagoda, Shwaay Dagon, which 
extended half a mile from the building, and were crossed by all 
the chief roads.&nbsp; At the same time, he was new gilding the 
pagoda, a specially sacred one, as containing some bits of hair 
of Gautama.</p>
<p>It was plain that the mission had little chance of succeeding,
unless some sanction could be obtained from royalty; and Mr. 
Judson therefore determined to go to Ava and petition the Emperor
to grant him permission to teach at Rangoon.&nbsp; So he obtained
a pass from the Viceroy &ldquo;to go up to the golden feet, and 
lift up our eyes to the golden face,&rdquo; and hired a boat to 
take him and Mr. Colman, with ten oarsmen, a headman, a 
steersman, a washerman, and two cooks, of whom Moung Nau was 
one.&nbsp; They had invited Shwaygnong to accompany them, but he 
refused, though he appeared waving his hand to them on the bank 
as they pushed off from the land.&nbsp; They took with them, as 
the most appropriate present, a Bible, bound in six volumes, in 
gold leaf, intending to ask permission to translate it.</p>
<p>They arrived at Ava on the 28th of January, 1820, and beheld 
the gilded roofs of the pagodas and palace.&nbsp; Two English 
residents welcomed them, and Mya-day-men, the Viceroy who had 
been their friend at Rangoon, undertook to present them to the 
Emperor.</p>
<p>They were taken to the palace, and were explaining their 
wishes to the Prime Minister, Moung Zah, when it was announced 
that &ldquo;the golden foot was about to advance,&rdquo; and he 
had to hasten to attend the Emperor.&nbsp; The dome whither the 
missionaries followed him was dazzling with splendour, very 
lofty, and supported on pillars entirely covered with gold, and 
forming long avenues, through one of which the Emperor advanced 
alone, with the proud gait and majesty of an Eastern monarch, 
with a gold-sheathed sword in his hand.&nbsp; Every one 
prostrated his forehead in the dust except the two Americans, who
merely knelt with folded hands.&nbsp; He paused before them, and 
demanded who they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The teachers, great king,&rdquo; replied Mr. 
Judson.</p>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; You speak Burmese&mdash;the priests 
that I heard of last night?&nbsp; When did you arrive?&nbsp; Are 
you like the Portuguese priests?&nbsp; Are you married?&rdquo; 
and so on, he asked; then placing himself on a high seat, with 
his hand on the hilt of his sword, he listened to the petition 
read aloud by Moung Zah.&nbsp; He then held out his hand for it; 
Moung Zah crawled forward and gave it; the Emperor read it 
through to himself, and held out his hand for the little tract 
which was handed to him in like manner.&nbsp; The hearts of the 
missionaries throbbed with hope and prayer; but, after reading 
the two first sentences, the Emperor threw it from him, and when 
the gift was presented would not notice it.&nbsp; The answer 
communicated through Moung Zah was: &ldquo;In regard to the 
objects of your petition, his Majesty gives no order.&nbsp; In 
regard to your sacred books, his Majesty has no use for them; 
take them away.&rdquo;&nbsp; Something was said of Colman&rsquo;s
skill in medicine; upon which the Emperor desired that both 
should be taken to the Portuguese priest, who acted as his 
physician, to ascertain whether they could be useful in that 
line, and then lay down on his cushions to listen to music.</p>
<p>They were taken two miles to the residence of the Portuguese, 
who of course perceived that they brought no wonderful secret of 
medicine, and then returned to their boat.&nbsp; They afterwards 
saw Moung Zah in private, and heard that the Burmese laws 
tolerated foreign religions, but that there was no security for 
natives who embraced them, and that it was an unpardonable 
offence even to propose it.&nbsp; The English collector went to 
the Emperor, but could obtain nothing from him but permission for
them to return to Rangoon, where they might find some of their 
countrymen to teach.&nbsp; There was no actual prohibition 
against teaching Burmese subjects, but there was no security that
the converts would not be persecuted; and the collector told them
that fifteen years previously a Burmese teacher who had been 
converted by the Portuguese, and had even visited Rome, was 
denounced on his return by his nephew and commanded to 
recant.&nbsp; On his refusal, he was tortured with the iron 
mall&mdash;hammered, namely, from his feet upwards till he was 
all one livid wound as far as his breast, pronouncing the name of
Christ at every blow.&nbsp; Some persons at last told the Emperor
that he was a mere madman, on which he was spared, and the 
Portuguese contrived to send him away to <!-- page 136--><a 
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Bengal, 
where he died.&nbsp; The nephew was high in the favour of the 
present Sovereign, who was besides far more attached than his 
grandfather had ever been to the Buddhist doctrine.&nbsp; Only 
four Portuguese clergy were in the country, and they confined 
themselves to ministrations to the descendants of the converts of
the old Jesuit mission, instead of attempting to extend their 
Church.&nbsp; Nothing was to be done but to return to Rangoon, 
and for this a passport was necessary, the obtaining of which 
cost thirty dollars in presents.&nbsp; Mr. Judson was advised 
also to procure a royal order for personal protection, otherwise,
when it became known that the royal patronage had been refused, 
he might be molested by ill-disposed persons; but finding that 
this would be exceedingly costly, he preferred &ldquo;trusting in
the Lord to keep us and our poor disciples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was encouraging that at Pyece, a place on the banks of the 
Irrawaddy, the missionaries met Shwaygnong, who had come thither 
to visit a sick friend, and came on board eagerly to know the 
result of their journey.&nbsp; They told him all, even of the 
good confession beneath the iron mall, and he seemed less 
affected and intimidated than they expected, though he had nearly
made up his mind to cast in his lot with them.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I 
die, I shall die in a good cause,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
know it is the cause of truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he repeated 
his actual faith: &ldquo;I believe in the Eternal God, in His Son
Jesus Christ, in the Atonement which Christ has made, and in the 
writings of the Apostles as the true and one Word of 
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also said he had never, since their last 
conversation, lifted up his folded hands before a pagoda, though 
on the day of worship, to avoid persecution, he would walk up one
side of the building and down the other.&nbsp; To this Mr. Judson
replied, &ldquo;You may be a disciple of Christ in heart, but you
are not a full disciple.&nbsp; You have not faith and resolution 
enough to keep all the commands of Christ, particularly that 
which commands you to be baptized though in the face of 
persecution and death.&nbsp; Consider the words of <span 
class="smcap">Jesus</span>&mdash;&lsquo;He that believeth and is 
baptized shall be saved.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened in profound silence, and with the manner with 
which he always received what he considered deeply; but there was
still a long struggle to come, and many fluctuations, and the 
simpler minds were the stay and comfort of the missionaries, when
on their return to Rangoon they considered <!-- page 137--><a 
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>what steps 
to take.&nbsp; Their first proposal was to move to a district 
between Bengal and Arracan, where were several Christian natives 
now destitute of a pastor, and where the language was very like 
Burmese, though the place was beyond the power of the Emperor, 
and to take their three baptized converts with them.&nbsp; Nau 
and Thaahlah were ready to follow them everywhere, but Byaay was 
married, and no Burmese woman was allowed to leave the 
country.&nbsp; He, with several others who were on the point of 
conversion, entreated the missionaries not to leave them, and 
Thaahlah made a remarkable speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be it 
remembered,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this work is not yours or
ours, but the work of God.&nbsp; If He give light, the religion 
will spread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was decided, according to the earnest wish of these poor 
people, that they should not be deserted till there were enough 
of them to form a congregation and have a teacher from among 
themselves set over them, and this&mdash;as the sect to which the
Judsons belonged has no form of setting apart for the 
ministry&mdash;was all that they regarded as requisite.&nbsp; The
Arracan converts were not, however, to be neglected, and Mr. 
Colman therefore was to go to Chittagong, and there establish a 
station, which might receive those from Rangoon in case it should
become needful to leave the place.&nbsp; He was doing well there,
when he died from an attack of fever.</p>
<p>The Judsons remained, and held their worship in the zayat on 
Sunday with the doors closed and only the initiated present; but 
it seemed as if the fear of losing their teachers quickened the 
zeal of the Christian converts in bringing their friends to 
inquire.&nbsp; Shwaygnong had long been unconsciously preparing 
the way by his philosophical instructions, going so much deeper 
than the popular Buddhism, and he brought several of his pupils, 
both male and female, telling them that &ldquo;he had found the 
true wisdom;&rdquo; but he still hung back. <a 
name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137" 
class="citation">[137]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Judson suspected him of 
wanting a companion of his own rank to keep him in countenance, 
and doubted whether it were fear of the world or pride of heart 
that kept him back; but he seems to have had a genuine battle 
with his own sceptical spirit, and the acceptance of such 
ordinances as the Baptists required was a difficulty to 
him.&nbsp; Four or five later converts were baptized before him, 
and at last he kept away from the mission for so <!-- page 
138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
138</span>long that Mr. Judson thought they had lost him; but 
when he reappeared it turned out that he had been ill with fever,
and had had much sickness in his family, and had meantime fought 
out his mental conflict, and made up his mind to the full 
acceptance of Christianity at all risks.</p>
<p>He came again with five disciples, one of them a woman of 
fifty-one years old, named Mah-menlay, with her husband, all 
formally requesting baptism; but Mr. Judson was not sufficiently 
satisfied of the earnestness of any to receive them at once, 
excepting Shwaygnong himself, whom Mr. Judson kept till evening; 
and then, after reading the history of St. Philip&rsquo;s baptism
of the Ethiopian, and praying, led him down to the water in the 
woods and baptized him, like others, in the pool, by the light of
the stars in the tropical night.&nbsp; That same night Mah-menlay
came back, entreating so earnestly for baptism, that she, too, 
was led down to the water and baptized.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; 
she said, &ldquo;I have taken the oath of allegiance to <span 
class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, and I have nothing to do but 
to commit myself, soul and body, to the hands of my Lord, assured
that He will never suffer me to fall away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the last thing before the Judsons embarked for 
Serampore, a journey necessitated by a severe attack of liver 
complaint, from which Mrs. Judson had long been suffering and 
their little girl had also died.</p>
<p>To these devoted people a visit to Calcutta was a change for 
the sake of health!&nbsp; On their return, after half a 
year&rsquo;s absence, the first thing they heard was that their 
kind friend Mya-day-men had come as Myowoon to Rangoon, and they 
were met on the wharf by all their disciples, led by Shwaygnong, 
in a state of rapture.&nbsp; They found that such as had lived in
the yard of the mission had been subjected to a petty official 
persecution, which had made them fly to the woods; but that the 
good Mya-day-men had refused to hear an accusation brought 
against Moung Shwaygnong by the lamas and officials of the 
village, who had him before the tribunal, accusing him of trying 
&ldquo;to turn the priest&rsquo;s rice-pot bottom 
upwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matters it,&rdquo; said the Myowoon; &ldquo;let 
the priests turn it back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was enough to ensure the safety of the Christians during 
his viceroyalty, though at first he paid little attention to Mr. 
Judson, being absorbed in grief for the death of his favourite 
<!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
139</span>daughter, one of the wives of the Emperor.&nbsp; She 
does not seem to have been the child of the amiable Vice-reine, 
or, as her title had now become, Woon-gyee-gaadaw, who had been 
promoted to the right of riding in a <i>wau</i>, a vehicle 
carried by forty or fifty men, but who had not forgotten Mrs. 
Judson, and received her affectionately.</p>
<p>There were now twenty-five disciples.&nbsp; Ing likewise 
joined them having returned from his voyage, and was shortly 
after baptized.&nbsp; Mah-menlay opened a school for little 
girls, and Shwaygnong was regularly engaged by Mr. Judson to 
revise his translation of the Epistle to the Ephesians and the 
first part of the Book of Acts, before they were printed.&nbsp; 
Another remarkable man came to study the subject, Moung Long, a 
philosopher of the most metaphysical kind, whose domestic 
conversations with his wife were reported to be of this 
description.&mdash;The wife would tell him, &ldquo;The rice is 
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rice! what is rice?&nbsp; Is it matter or spirit?&nbsp;
Is it an idea or a nonentity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she answered, &ldquo;It is matter,&rdquo; he would reply, 
&ldquo;And what is matter?&nbsp; Are you sure there is such a 
thing in existence, or are you merely subject to a delusion of 
the senses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson was struck with the expression of this man&rsquo;s 
one eye, which had &ldquo;as great a quantity of being as 
half-a-dozen common eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; After the first exposition
of the Christian doctrine, the philosopher began with extreme 
suavity and politeness: &ldquo;Your lordship says that in the 
beginning God created one man and one woman.&nbsp; I do not 
understand (I beg your lordship&rsquo;s pardon) what a man is, 
and why he is called a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson does not record his own line of argument, only that
the Buddhist sceptic was foiled, and Shwaygnong, who had often 
argued with him, was delighted to see his old adversary 
posed.&nbsp; He came again and again, and so did his wife, the 
ablest woman whom Mrs. Judson had met, asking questions on the 
possibility of sin finding entrance to a pure mind, and they were
soon promising catechumens; but in the midst of all this 
hopefulness, a season of cholera and fever set in, both the 
Judsons were taken ill at the same time, and could not even help 
one another, and the effect on Ann&rsquo;s health was such that, 
as the only means of saving her life, she was sent off at once to
England, while her husband remained at his post quite alone, for 
Colman had died a martyr to the climate.</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>She was warmly welcomed by the Missionary Societies in 
London and Edinburgh, and thence returned to America, where her 
mother and sisters were still living to hail her return.&nbsp; 
Her narratives, backed by her natural sweetness, eloquence and 
beauty, had a great effect in stirring up the mission spirit 
among both her countrymen and countrywomen, and there was no lack
of recruits willing to return with her and share her toil.</p>
<p>The account of Colman&rsquo;s devotion and death had had an 
especial effect upon a young girl named Sarah Hall, of Salem, 
Massachusetts, one of those natures that seem peculiarly gifted 
with poetic enthusiasm, yet able to stand the brunt of the 
severest test of practice.&nbsp; She was the daughter of one of 
those old-fashioned New England families, where a considerable 
amount of prosperity and a good deal of mental culture is 
compatible with much personal homely exertion.&nbsp; As the 
eldest of thirteen, Sarah had to work hard, but all the time she 
kept a prim little journal, recording, at an age when one is 
surprised to see her able to write at all, that her mother is too
busy to let her go to school, and she must improve herself at 
home; and this she really did, for her notes, as she grew older, 
speak of studying Butler&rsquo;s Analogy, Paley&rsquo;s 
Evidences, logic, geometry, and Latin.&nbsp; Her library of 
poetry is said to have consisted only of Thomson&rsquo;s Castle 
of Indolence, and Macpherson&rsquo;s Ossian; but hymns must have 
filled her ear with the ring of rhyme, for she was continually 
versifying, sometimes passages of Scripture, sometimes Ossian, 
long before she was halfway through her teens.&nbsp; Very 
foolish, sing-song, emotional specimens they are, but notable as 
showing the bent of nature that forms itself into heroism.&nbsp; 
Her family were Baptists, and she was sixteen when the sense of 
religion came on her so strongly as to lead her to seek 
baptism.&nbsp; Remarkably enough, the thought of the ignorance of
the heathen, and the desire to teach them, began to haunt her 
from that time, and is recorded in the last page of her childish 
journal, dated a month later than her baptism.</p>
<p>In fact, her zeal seems to have been pretty strong towards the
persons around her.&nbsp; While staying at a friend&rsquo;s 
house, she found a pack of cards left by a young man on the 
table, and wrote on it the text beginning, &ldquo;Remember now 
thy Creator in the days of thy youth,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; 
Hearing that the owner was <!-- page 141--><a 
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>very 
curious to know the perpetrator, she wrote down this verse for 
him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And wouldst thou know what friend 
sincere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reminds thee of thy day of doom?<br />
Repress the wish, yet thou mayst hear<br />
She shed for thee a pitying tear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For thine are paths of gloom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She also says that she had been for six weeks engaged, with 
the assistance of a gentleman, in working out proofs of the 
immortality of the soul, apart from those in Scripture.&nbsp; She
had prayer-meetings for her young friends in her own room, and 
distributed tracts in the town, while still acting at home, as 
her mother&rsquo;s right hand, among her little brothers and 
sisters.</p>
<p>But her vocation she felt to be for missionary life.&nbsp; At 
one time she thought of joining a mission to the Red Indians, and
her verses were full of the subject.&nbsp; Her ode on 
Colman&rsquo;s death expressed the feeling of her soul in the 
verse:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The spirit of love from on high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hearts of the righteous hath fired;<br />
Lo! they come, and with transport they cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;We will go where our brother expired,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And labour and 
die.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words fall sadly short of the feeling,&mdash;a very real 
one, but the ode not only satisfied Sarah&rsquo;s critics and 
obtained circulation, but it fired the heart of George Dana 
Boardman, a young student at Waterville College, intended for the
Baptist ministry; and he never rested till he had found out the 
authoress, met her, and asked her to be his partner in 
&ldquo;labouring and dying,&rdquo; as Colman had done before 
them.</p>
<p>There was no illusion in her mind; she knew her task would be 
full of toil and suffering; but her feeling was the desire to 
devote her whole self to the work of the Redeemer, who had done 
so much for her.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Hall were at first reluctant,
but after a time heartily consented, and she was introduced to 
Mrs. Judson as a future companion in her toils.&nbsp; With very 
questionable taste, some of her friends insisted on her reading 
her own elegy on Colman, aloud, before a whole circle of friends 
that they might see Mrs. Judson listen to it.&nbsp; Blushes and 
refusals were of no avail; she was dragged out, and the paper 
thrust into her hand; she began, faltering, but as she proceeded 
<!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
142</span>the strong purpose of her soul inspired her, and she 
ended with firmness and enthusiasm&mdash;but was so overpowered 
that, without daring to look up and see that Mrs. Judson&rsquo;s 
eyes were overflowing, she crept away to hide in a corner the 
burning tears on her own cheeks.&nbsp; Twenty years after she 
spoke of it as one of the most painful moments of her life.</p>
<p>At first it had been proposed that Mr. Boardman and Sarah 
should accompany Mrs. Judson on her return, but it was thought 
better that he should spend a little more time on his studies, 
and Ann Judson therefore sailed in 1823, with Mr. and Mrs. Wade 
as her companions.</p>
<p>In the meantime Judson himself had been going on with his work
at Rangoon, among many troubles.</p>
<p>Another accusation was drawn up by the lamas against 
Shwaygnong, and the Viceroy, on reading it, pronounced him worthy
of death; but before he could be arrested, he took boat, came 
down to the mission-house with his family, obtained a supply of 
tracts and portions of Scripture, and then secretly fled up the 
river to a town named Shway-doung, where he began to argue and 
distribute the tracts.&nbsp; So little regular communication was 
there between different places in Burmah, that this could be done
with comparative safety; but the accusation and his flight 
created so much alarm at Rangoon, that Mr. Judson had to shut up 
the zayat, and only assemble his converts in the 
mission-house.&nbsp; They suffered another loss in Moung 
Thaahlah, their second convert, who died of cholera, after 
nineteen hours&rsquo; illness.&nbsp; He had seven months before 
married a young Christian woman, this being the first Burmese 
Christian wedding; and as he was a youth of much promise and good
education, he was a serious loss to the mission.&nbsp; All this 
time Mr. Judson was alone, until the arrival of Jonathan Price, 
who had wisely qualified himself to act as a physician, and no 
sooner did a report of his skill reach Ava, than the King sent 
for him; and as he had no time to learn the language, Judson went
with him as interpreter.&nbsp; Dr. Price says, &ldquo;The King is
a man of small stature, very straight, steps with a natural air 
of superiority, but has not the least appearance of it in 
conversation.&nbsp; He wears a red, finely-striped silk cloth 
from his waist to his knees, and a blue-and-white handkerchief on
his head.&nbsp; He has apparently the good of his people as well 
as the glory of his kingdom at heart, and is encouraging foreign 
merchants, and especially <!-- page 143--><a 
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>artisans to
settle in his capital.&nbsp; A watchmaker at this moment could 
obtain any favour he should please to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the missionaries arrived, he sent for them and 
received them in an open court, where they were seated on a 
bamboo floor about ten feet from his chair.&nbsp; He took no 
notice of Judson, except as an interpreter, but interrogated 
Price as to his skill in surgery, sent for his medicines, looked 
at them and at his instrument, and was greatly amused with his 
galvanic battery; he then dismissed them with orders to choose a 
spot on which a house should be built for them, and to look up 
the diseased to try Price&rsquo;s skill upon.</p>
<p>Moung Zah, the former minister, recognized Judson kindly, and 
after a time the King took notice of him: &ldquo;You in black, 
what are you, a medical man too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a medical man, but a teacher of religion, your 
Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few questions about his religion the King proceeded to
ask whether any Burmese had embraced it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; diplomatically said Judson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any in Rangoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they foreigners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson says he trembled for the consequences of an answer,
but the truth must be spoken at all risks, and he replied, 
&ldquo;Some foreigners and some Burmese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King showed no displeasure, but asked questions on 
religion, geography, and astronomy, as though his temper was 
quite changed.&nbsp; His brother, a fine young man of 
twenty-eight, who suffered from paralysis, became a patient of 
Dr. Price, and had much conversation with Judson, showing great 
eagerness for instruction.&nbsp; He assured the missionaries that
under the present reign there was no danger to the native 
Christians, and after a successful operation for cataract, 
performed by Dr. Price, the missionaries were so much in favour 
that while Price remained at Ava and there married a native lady,
Judson was desired only to go back to Rangoon to meet his wife on
her return, and bring her to reside at Ava.</p>
<p>Their good and tolerant friend, the Viceroy, was dead, and his
successor was a severe and unjust man, so that the people had 
fled in numbers from the place, and few Christians remained 
except at Moung Shwaygnong&rsquo;s village.&nbsp; There was thus 
the less <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>to leave, when in December 1823 Mrs.
Judson safely arrived, and two fresh missionaries with her, to 
whom the flock at Rangoon could be left.&nbsp; There is a most 
happy letter written on the voyage up the Irrawaddy to Ava, when 
it seemed as though all the troubles and difficulties of four 
years had been smoothed away.&nbsp; The mission had been kindly 
welcomed at Ava, and established in the promised house, when the 
first of the English wars with Burmah broke out, on grounds on 
which it is needless to enter.&nbsp; It is enough to say that 
after many mutual offences, Sir Archibald Campbell, with a fleet 
and army, entered Rangoon, and occupied it without resistance, 
the Viceroy being absent at the time.</p>
<p>The Court of Ava were exceedingly amazed at the insolence of 
the foreigners.&nbsp; An army supposed to be irresistible was 
sent off, dancing and singing, in boats down the river, and all 
the fear was lest the alarm should drive away the white strangers
with the &ldquo;cock-feather chief&rdquo; before there was time 
to catch any for slaves.&nbsp; A lady sent a commission for four 
to manage the affairs of her household, as she heard they were 
trustworthy; a courtier, for six to row his boat.</p>
<p>The capture of Rangoon was supposed by national pride to be 
wholly owing to the treachery of spies, and three English 
merchants were fixed upon as those spies and put under 
arrest.&nbsp; The King was advised likewise to secure the persons
of the missionaries, but he answered, &ldquo;They are quiet men; 
let them alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, a receipt 
for some money paid to Adoniram Judson was found among the papers
of one of the merchants, and this to the Burmese mind was proof 
of his complicity in the plot.&nbsp; Suddenly, an official, 
accompanied by a dozen men, one of whom had his face marked with 
spots, to denote his being an executioner, made his appearance 
demanding Mr. Judson.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are called by the 
King,&rdquo; said the official, and at the same moment the 
executioner produced a cord, threw Mr. Judson on the floor, and 
tied his arms behind his back.&nbsp; His wife vainly offered 
money to have his arms unbound, and he was led away, the faithful
Ing following at a distance to see what was done with him, while 
Mrs. Judson retired to her room and poured out her soul &ldquo;to
Him who for our sakes was bound and led away to execution,&rdquo;
and great was her comfort even in that moment.&nbsp; She was 
immediately after summoned to be examined by a magistrate in the 
verandah, and <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>after hastily destroying all 
journals and papers, went out to meet him.&nbsp; He took down her
name and age, those of four little Burmese girls she had charge 
of, and of two Bengal servants; pronounced them all slaves to the
King, and set a guard over them.&nbsp; Mrs. Judson fastened 
herself and her children into the inner room, while the guards 
threatened her savagely if she would not show herself, and even 
put her servants&rsquo; feet in the stocks till she had obtained 
their release by promises of money.</p>
<p>Moung Ing had ascertained that his master was in prison; and 
when, after the most dreadful night she had ever spent, she sent 
him again in the morning, with a piece of silver to obtain 
admittance, he brought word that both Judson and Price, with the 
three English merchants, were in the death-prison, each wearing 
three pairs of iron fetters and fastened to a long pole.&nbsp; 
Mrs. Judson immediately sent to the governor of the city with an 
entreaty to be allowed to visit him with a present.&nbsp; This 
procured her a favourable reception, and he promised to make the 
condition of the prisoners more comfortable, but told her that 
she must consult his head writer as to the means.&nbsp; This man,
a brutal-looking fellow, extorted from her a huge bribe, and then
promised to release the two teachers from the pole, and to put 
them into another building where she might send them food daily, 
and pillows and mats to sleep on.&nbsp; She obtained an order for
an interview with her husband, whose looks were so wretched and 
ghastly that she lost no time in fulfilling these exorbitant 
demands.</p>
<p>Her hope was in a petition to the Queen, but being under 
arrest herself, she could not go to the Queen in person, and had 
to approach her through her sister-in-law&mdash;a proud, haughty 
dame, who received her in the most cold, discouraging manner, but
who undertook to present the petition.&nbsp; She then went to the
prison again, but the head writer would not allow her to enter; 
and on her return home she found that all the property in the 
mission-house was to undergo a scrutiny; but this was humanely 
done, and was only inventoried, not seized&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the 
King did not seize it, but the officials helped themselves to 
whatever took their fancy.&nbsp; The next day the Queen&rsquo;s 
answer was obtained&mdash;&ldquo;He is not to be executed; let 
him remain where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor lady&rsquo;s heart fainted within her, but she 
thought of <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>the widow and the unjust judge, and 
persevered day after day in applying to every member of the royal
family or of Government to entreat for her husband&rsquo;s 
liberation.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s mother, sisters, and brother 
were all interested in his favour, but none of them ventured to 
apply direct to the King lest they should offend the favourite 
Queen.&nbsp; All failed, but the hopes that from time to time 
were excited, kept up the spirits of the sufferers.&nbsp; During 
the long weary months while the missionaries continued in 
fetters, <i>i.e.</i> chained by the feet to a bar of bamboo, Mrs.
Judson was often not allowed to visit them for ten days at a 
time, and then only by walking to the prison after dark, two 
miles, unattended.&nbsp; She could, however, communicate with her
husband by means of the provisions she sent him daily.&nbsp; At 
first she used to write on the dough of a flat cake, which she 
afterwards baked and concealed in a bowl of rice, while he 
answered by writing on a tile, where the inscription disappeared 
when dry but was visible when wet; but latterly they found it 
most convenient to write on a roll of paper hidden in the long 
nose of a coffee-pot, in which tea was sent to the prisoners.</p>
<p>Mrs. Judson delighted to send him little surprises, once a 
mince-pie, which Moung Ing carried with the utmost pride to his 
imprisoned master.&nbsp; Mrs. Judson found herself obliged to 
wear the native dress, though she was so much taller than the 
Burmese women that she could be hardly taken for one of 
them.&nbsp; It was a becoming dress; her hair was drawn into a 
knot on the forehead, with a cocoa-blossom, like a white plume, 
drooping from it; a saffron vest open in front to show a crimson 
tunic below; and a tight skirt of rich silk, sloping down behind,
made her look to advantage, so that her husband liked to remember
her as she stood at his prison door.&nbsp; She never was allowed 
to come further.</p>
<p>For twenty days she was absent, and then she came with a tiny,
pale, wailing, blue-eyed baby on her breast.&nbsp; Poor Judson, 
clanking up to the door in his chains to welcome his little 
daughter, commemorated his feelings in some touching verses 
ending:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And when in future years<br />
Thou know&rsquo;st thy father&rsquo;s tongue,<br />
These lines will show thee how he felt,<br />
How o&rsquo;er his babe he sung.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every defeat by the European forces added to the perils of 
<!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
147</span>captives.&nbsp; A favourite old general named Bundoolah
had promised, when sent to command the army against Rangoon, that
he would release all the white prisoners on his return as a 
conqueror; and when he was totally defeated, the wrath of the 
Burmese was so great that at this time the King himself seems to 
have scarcely acted at all.&nbsp; He was gentle, indolent and 
indifferent, more intelligent than those around him, scarcely a 
Buddhist in belief, and very kind-hearted: indeed Judson believed
that it was his interposition alone that prevented the lives of 
the captives from being taken at once; but he was demoralized by 
self-indulgence, and allowed himself to be governed by his queen,
the daughter of a superintendent of gaols; and through her, by 
her brother, who was cruel, rapacious and violent, and the chief 
author of all the sufferings inflicted on the prisoners.&nbsp; 
Among these were seven or eight British officers, and the King 
had commanded that a daily allowance of rice should be served to 
these, but scarcely half of it ever reached them; Mrs. Judson did
her best to supply them as well as her husband, but their health 
gave way under their sufferings, and all died but one.</p>
<p>At the end of seven months, it was reported that the English 
army was advancing into the interior; and in the passionate alarm
thus excited, the English captives were all loaded with five 
pairs of fetters and thrown into the common prison among Burman 
thieves and robbers,&mdash;a hundred in a room without a window, 
and that in the hottest season of the year.&nbsp; Mrs. Judson 
again besought the governor to relieve them from this horrible 
condition, by at least allowing them to sit outside the door, and
he actually shed tears at her distress, but he told her that he 
had been commanded to put them all to death privately, and that 
he was doing his best for them by massing them with the 
rest.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s brother had really given this 
order, but the governor delayed the execution in case they should
be required of him by the King, and they continued in this 
frightful state for a whole month, until Mr. Judson sickened with
violent fever, and the governor permitted him to be removed into 
a little bamboo room, six feet long and four wide, where his wife
was allowed to visit him and bring him food and medicine, she 
meantime living in a bamboo house in the governor&rsquo;s 
compound, where the thermometer rose daily to 106&deg;, but where
she thought herself happy as she saw her husband begin to 
recover.</p>
<p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>One day, however, when the governor had sent for her 
and was kindly conversing with her, a servant came in and 
whispered to him that the white strangers had suddenly been taken
away, no one knew whither.&nbsp; The governor pretended to be 
taken by surprise, but there could be no doubt that he had 
occupied Mrs. Judson to hinder her from witnessing the removal; 
and it was not till the evening that she learnt that the 
prisoners had been taken to Umerapoonah, whither she proceeded 
with her three months old baby and one servant.&nbsp; There she 
found that the prisoners had been sent on two hours before to a 
sort of penal settlement called Oung-pen-lay, whither she 
followed, to find her husband in a lamentable state.&nbsp; He had
been dragged out of his little room, allowed no clothing but his 
shirt and trowsers, a rope had been tied round his waist, and he 
had been literally driven ten miles in the hottest part of the 
day.&nbsp; His feet were so lacerated that he was absolutely 
falling, when a servant of one of the merchants tore a piece from
his turban, and this wrapped round his feet enabled him to 
proceed, but he could not stand for six weeks after; indeed the 
scars remained for life.&nbsp; In this state he lay chained to 
Dr. Price.&nbsp; The intention was to sacrifice them both, in 
order to obtain success for an intended expedition; but before 
this could be done, a different woongye, or prime minister, came 
in, and their condition was somewhat improved, for they only wore
one bamboo, through two slits in which their feet were forced, 
and they were allowed to crawl into the enclosure.&nbsp; 
Meantime, a poor lion, once a great favourite, which was thought 
to be connected with the lions on the English colours, was placed
in a bamboo cage in sight of the prisoners, and there starved to 
death, in hopes of thus abating the force of the enemy.&nbsp; 
When its carcase was removed, Mr. Judson, at his own earnest 
entreaty, was allowed the reversion of its cage, and there, to 
his great joy, Moung Ing brought him his MS. translation of part 
of the Burmese Bible, which he had kept in his pillow at Ava till
it was torn away by the jailors on his removal.&nbsp; The 
faithful Ing, thinking only to secure a relic of his master, had 
picked up the pillow and secured the treasure.</p>
<p>Solitude was the greatest boon to Judson, whose fastidious 
delicacy suffered greatly in the thronged prison, but his 
faithful Ann was suffering terribly.&nbsp; One of the little 
Burmese girls who lived with her had caught the small-pox, and 
was very ill: Mrs. Judson inoculated the other child and her own 
little <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>Maria, but Maria&rsquo;s inoculation
did not take effect, and she caught the disease, and had it very 
severely.&nbsp; Then Mrs. Judson herself fell ill of a fever, and
remained for two months unable to visit her husband, both of them
owing all their food to the exertions of their good Bengalee 
cook.&nbsp; Poor little Maria was nearly starved, no milk was to 
be had, and the only food she obtained was when the jailers were 
bribed to let her father carry her round the village to beg a 
little nourishment from the nursing mothers.&nbsp; Her moans at 
night rent the heart of her sick mother, and it is scarcely 
possible to imagine how either survived.&nbsp; By this time, the 
English troops were so far advancing that the King was reduced to
negotiate, and, being in need of an interpreter, he sent an order
for Mr. Judson&rsquo;s release; but as his wife was not named in 
it, she had great difficulty in effecting her departure, and 
half-way through the journey a guard came down and carried him 
off to Ava without her.&nbsp; Arriving next day, she found him in
prison, but under orders to embark in a little boat and go at 
once to the camp at Maloun.&nbsp; She hastened to prepare all 
that was needful for his comfort, but all was stolen except a 
mattress, pillow, and one blanket.&nbsp; The boat had no awning, 
and was so crowded that there was no room to lie down for the 
three days and three nights of alternate scorching heat and heavy
dew; there was no food but a bag of refuse-rice, and the banks on
either side of the Irrawaddy were bordered with glittering white 
sand, which in sunlight emitted a metallic glare intolerable to 
the eyes, and heat like a burning furnace.&nbsp; The fever 
returned upon Judson, and, when he reached Maloun, he was almost 
helpless; but he found himself lodged in a small bamboo hut in 
the middle of the white sand, where he could not admit air by 
rolling up the matting without letting in the distressing glare, 
and where the heat reflected from the sand was like a 
furnace.&nbsp; He could not stir when the officers came to summon
him to the presence of the Burmese general, and they thought it 
stubbornness, and threatened him; then they brought him papers 
and commanded him to translate them, while he writhed in torture 
and only longed that the fever in his brain would deprive him of 
his senses.&nbsp; This it must have done, for he had only a 
confused impression of feet around him, and of fancying that he 
was going to be burnt alive, until he found himself on a bed in a
somewhat cooler room.&nbsp; As he lay there, papers were <!-- 
page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
150</span>continually brought him to explain and translate, and 
he found that the greatest difficulty was in making the Burmese 
understand that a State paper could mean what it said, or that 
truth and honesty were possible.&nbsp; Sometimes, as he tried to 
explain the commonest principle: of good faith and fair dealing 
among Christian nations, his auditors would exclaim, &ldquo;That 
is noble,&rdquo; &ldquo;That is as it should be;&rdquo; but then 
they would shake their heads and say, &ldquo;The teacher dreams; 
he has a heavenly spirit, and so he thinks himself in the land of
the dwellers in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remained here six weeks, suffering much at night from cold,
for his only covering was a small rug and his well-worn 
blanket.&nbsp; Then, on the advance of the English, he was sent 
back to Ava, but was marched straight to the court-house without 
being suffered to halt for a moment at his own abode, to discover
whether his wife was there.&nbsp; He was placed in a shed, 
guarded all day, and left without food, till Moung Ing found him 
out in the evening, and replied to his questions, that the Mamma 
Judson and the child were well; yet there was something about his
manner that was unsatisfactory, and Judson, thinking it over, 
became terribly uneasy, and in the morning, being sent for by the
governor of the jail, obtained permission to go to his own 
house.</p>
<p>At the door he saw a fat, half-naked Burmese woman with a 
child in her arms, so dark with dirt that it never occurred to 
him that it could be his own; and entering, he found, lying 
across the foot of the bed, his wife, ghastly white and 
emaciated, her hair all cut away, and her whole appearance that 
of a corpse.&nbsp; She woke as he knelt down by her in 
despair!&nbsp; She had been ill all this time with a horrible 
spotted fever.&nbsp; The day she had fallen ill, the Burmese 
woman had offered to take charge of little Maria, and the 
Bengalee cook had attended on her.&nbsp; Dr. Price was released 
from prison and had cut off her hair, bled, and blistered her, 
but she could hardly move when the tidings came of her husband 
being in the town, and she had sent Moung Ing to him.&nbsp; The 
husband and wife were at last together again, and Dr. Price was 
sent to conduct the treaty at the English camp.</p>
<p>As soon as Sir Archibald Campbell heard of the sufferings of 
the Judsons, he demanded them as well as the English subjects; 
but the King was aware that they were not English, <!-- page 
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
151</span>and would not let them go.&nbsp; This attempt at a 
treaty failed; but its failure, and the alarm consequent upon a 
report of the advance of the English, led to Mr. Judson&rsquo;s 
being sent off, almost by force, with two officials, to promise a
ransom if Ava were spared.&nbsp; Sir Archibald Campbell undertook
that the city should not be attacked, provided his terms were 
complied with before he reached it; and among these was the 
stipulation that not only English subjects, but all foreigners 
should have free choice whether to go or to stay.&nbsp; Some of 
the officials tried to persuade Mr. Judson to stay, declaring 
that he would become a great man, but he could not refuse the 
freedom offered him after such cruel sufferings, and he was wont 
to declare that the joy of finding himself floating down the 
Irrawaddy in a boat with his wife and baby, made up for their 
twenty-one months of peril and misery.</p>
<p>They were received with courtesy, and indeed with gratitude, 
respect, and veneration at the English camp.&nbsp; The Englishmen
who had been in captivity bore witness to the kindness with which
Mrs. Judson had relieved their wants, as well as those of her 
husband: how she had brought them food, mended their clothes, 
obtained new ones, and, as they believed, by her arguments and 
appeals to the ignorant and barbarous Government, had not only 
saved their lives, but convinced the authorities of the necessity
of accepting the British terms of peace.</p>
<p>These terms included the cession of a large portion of the 
Burmese territory; and this it was that decided the missionaries 
to leave Ava; for the state of exasperation and intolerance into 
which this brought the Court, made it vain to think of continuing
to give instruction where they would be regarded with enmity and 
suspicion.&nbsp; Meantime, the officers in the English camp, who 
had not seen a lady for nearly two years, could not make enough 
of the graceful, gentle woman, so pale and fragile, yet such a 
dauntless heroine, and always ready to exert herself beyond her 
strength for every sufferer who came in her way.</p>
<p>There was a curious scene at a dinner given to the Burmese 
commissioners, in a magnificent tent, with all the military pomp 
the camp could furnish.&nbsp; When Sir Archibald appeared with 
Mrs. Judson on his arm, and seated her by his side, there was 
such a look of discomfiture on the faces of the guests, that he 
asked her if they were not old acquaintance who had treated her 
ill.&nbsp; &ldquo;That fellow with the pointed beard,&rdquo; he 
said, <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>&ldquo;seems taken with an ague 
fit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Mrs. Judson told how, when her husband lay
in a burning fever with the five pairs of fetters, she had walked
several miles with a petition to this man, had been kept waiting 
till the noontide sun was at its height, and not only was she 
refused, but as she departed her silk umbrella was torn out of 
her hand by his greediness; and when she begged at least to let 
her have a paper one to go home with, the officer only laughed at
her, and told her that she was too thin to be in danger of a 
sunstroke!&nbsp; The English gentlemen could not restrain their 
countenances at least from expressing their indignation; and the 
Burmese, who thought she was asking for their heads, or to have 
them laid out in the sun with weights upon their chests, were 
yellow with fright, and trembled visibly.&nbsp; Mrs. Judson 
kindly turned to them with a smile, assuring them that they had 
nothing to fear, and, on repeating her words to Sir Archibald 
Campbell, he confirmed them to the frightened barbarians.</p>
<p>That visit to the English camp was one of the few spaces of 
comfort or repose in those busy lives.&nbsp; It concluded by the 
husband and wife being forwarded to their old home at 
Rangoon.</p>
<p>It was in the height of the war, when anxieties for the fate 
of Mr. and Mrs. Judson were at the utmost, that, on the 4th of 
July, 1825, George Boardman and Sarah Hall were married, and 
sailed for Calcutta, thinking it possible that they might find 
their predecessors martyred, and that they were coming &ldquo;to 
step where their comrades stood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Calcutta they found Mr. and Mrs. Wade, who had with great 
difficulty escaped, and soon after they heard of the rescue of 
the Judsons, and welcomed Dr. Price.&nbsp; Rangoon, in the 
meantime, had been occupied by the English, and then besieged by 
the Peguans; the mission-house was ruined, and the people 
dispersed, and Moung Shwaygnong had died of cholera, faithful to 
the last.&nbsp; The city was to be restored to the Burmese, and 
the King, though willing to employ Judson politically, refused 
toleration to his subjects; so that, as the provinces on the 
Martaban river were to be ceded to the English, it seemed wise to
take advantage of the reputation which the Judsons had 
established to found a mission-station under their protection in 
the new town of Amherst, which Sir Archibald Campbell proposed to
build on the banks of the Martaban river.</p>
<p><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Hither was transported the old zayat of Rangoon; and 
Mount Ing, Moung Shwaba, and a few other of the flock accompanied
their teachers, to form the nucleus of the mission.&nbsp; Sir 
Archibald Campbell had made a great point of Mr. Judson&rsquo;s 
accompanying the English embassy that was to conclude the treaty 
at Ava; and he, hoping to obtain something for the Christian 
cause, complied, leaving that most brave and patient woman, his 
wife, with her little delicate girl, in a temporary house in 
Amherst, which, as yet, consisted only of barracks, 
officers&rsquo; houses, and fifty native huts by the riverside in
the space of freshly-cleared jungle.&nbsp; There she set to work 
with energy that enfeebled health could not daunt, to prepare the
way for the Wades and the Boardmans, to superintend a little 
school, of which Moung Ing was master, and to have a house built 
for her husband.</p>
<p>She had just moved into it, when she was attacked with 
remittent fever, and, though attended by an English army surgeon 
and nursed by a soldier&rsquo;s wife, she sank under it, and died
on the 24th of October, 1826.&nbsp; She was buried under a 
<i>hopia</i>, or, as her friends loved to call it, a hope tree; 
and the Wades, coming shortly after, took charge of poor little 
Maria, who lived to be embraced by her father, on his arrival 
after three months&rsquo; absence; but she continued to pine 
away, and only survived her mother six months.</p>
<p>Judson endured patiently, thought of his wife&rsquo;s 
sufferings as gems in her crown, wrote cheerful letters, and 
toiled indefatigably, without breaking down, but he was never the
same man again.&nbsp; Amherst was probably unhealthy, for several
of the Rangoon converts died there, among them one of the little 
Burmese girls who had been with Mrs. Judson throughout her 
troubles.&nbsp; Those who died almost always spoke with joy of 
their hope of seeing Mamma Judson in heaven.&nbsp; &ldquo;But 
first,&rdquo; said one woman, &ldquo;I shall fall down before the
Saviour&rsquo;s feet, and thank Him for sending us our 
teachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was shortly before little Maria&rsquo;s death that Mr. and 
Mrs. Boardman arrived, bringing with them a daughter born at 
Calcutta.&nbsp; Moulmein, the town near at hand, was decided on 
as their station, and they removed to a mission-house on the 
border of the jungle, about a mile from the cantonments, with a 
beautiful range of hills behind them, and the river in 
front.&nbsp; Opposite lay the Burman province of Martaban, which 
had <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>been desolated during the war, and 
was now the haunt of terrible Malay pirates, who came and robbed 
in the town, and then fled securely to the opposite bank, where 
they could not be pursued.&nbsp; The English officers had 
entreated the Boardmans to reside within the cantonments, but 
they wished to be among the people, so as to learn the language 
more readily and become acquainted with them.</p>
<p>One night, Mrs. Boardman awoke and found the lamp gone 
out.&nbsp; She rose and re-lighted it.&nbsp; Every box and drawer
lay overthrown and rifled, nothing left but what the thieves 
deemed not worth taking.&nbsp; She turned round to the mosquito 
curtain which concealed her husband; it was cut by two long 
gashes, the one close to his head, the other to his feet.&nbsp; 
There the robber-sentry must have kept watch, ready to destroy 
the sleepers if they had wakened for a moment!&nbsp; Nearly every
valuable had been carried away, and not a trace of any was ever 
found.&nbsp; After this, Sir Archibald Campbell gave them a Sepoy
guard; and, as population increased, the danger diminished.&nbsp;
Indeed, Amherst proved an unsuccessful attempt, and was gradually
abandoned in favour of Moulmein, which became the head-quarters 
both of Government and of the Mission.</p>
<p>The Boardmans were specially devoted to that, because of the 
work which regarded the Karens.&nbsp; These were a wandering race
who occupied a strip of jungle, a hilly country to the south of 
Burmah, living chiefly by hunting and fishing, making canoes, and
clothed in cotton cloth.&nbsp; They had very scanty ideas either 
of religion or civilization, but were not idolaters, and had a 
good many of what Judson calls the gentler virtues of savages, 
though their habits were lazy and dirty.&nbsp; They had been a 
good deal misused by the Burmese, but occasionally wandered into 
the cities; and there Judson had asked questions about them which
had roused the interest of his Burman converts.&nbsp; During the 
war, one of these Burmese found a poor Karen, named Ko-Thah-byoo,
in bondage for debt, paid the amount, made him his own servant, 
and, on the removal to Moulmein, brought him thither.&nbsp; He 
proved susceptible of instruction, and full of energy and zeal; 
and not only embraced Christianity heartily himself, but 
introduced it to his tribe, and assisted the missionaries in 
acquiring the language.</p>
<p>To be nearer to these people, the Boardmans removed to <!-- 
page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
155</span>Tavoy, where they had a Burmese congregation; and Mr. 
Boardman made an expedition among the Karens, who were, for the 
most part, by no means unwilling to listen, and with little 
tradition to pre-occupy their minds, as well as intelligence 
enough to receive new ideas.&nbsp; At one place, the people were 
found devoted to an object that was thought to have magic power, 
and which they kept with great veneration, wrapt up in many 
coverings.&nbsp; It proved to be an English Common Prayer Book, 
printed at Oxford, which had been left behind by a Mahometan 
traveller.&nbsp; On the whole, this has been a flourishing 
mission; the Karens were delighted to have their language reduced
to writing, and the influence of their teachers began to raise 
them in the scale; but all was done under the terrible drawback 
of climate.&nbsp; Mrs. Boardman never was well from the time she 
landed at Moulmein, and her beautiful flower-covered house at 
Tavoy was the constant haunt of sickness, under which her elder 
child, Sarah, died, after showing all that precocity that white 
children often do in these fatal regions.&nbsp; A little boy 
named George had by this time been born, and shared with his 
mother the dangers of the Tavoy rebellion, an insurrection 
stirred up by a prince of the Burmese royal blood, in hopes of 
wresting the province from the English.</p>
<p>One night, a Burmese lad belonging to the school close to the 
Boardmans&rsquo; house, was awakened by steps; and, peeping 
through the braided bamboo walls of his hut, saw parties of men 
talking in an undertone about lost buffaloes.&nbsp; Some went 
into the town, others gathered about the gate, and, when their 
numbers began to thicken, a cloud of smoke was seen in the 
morning dawn, and yells from a thousand voices proclaimed, 
&ldquo;Tavoy has risen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boardman awoke and rushed out to the door, but a friendly 
voice told him that no harm was intended him.&nbsp; The revolt 
was against the English, and never was a movement more 
perilous.&nbsp; The commandant, Colonel Burney, was absent at 
Moulmein, the English officer next in command was ill of a fatal 
disease, the gunner was ill, and the whole defence of a long, 
straggling city was in the hands of a hundred Sepoys, commanded 
by a very young surgeon, assisted by Mrs. Burney, who had a babe 
of three weeks old.&nbsp; The chief of the fight was at the 
powder magazine, not very far from the Boardmans&rsquo; 
abode.&nbsp; It was attacked by two hundred men with clubs, 
knives, spears, <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>but happily with very few muskets, 
and defended by only six Sepoys, who showed great readiness and 
faithfulness.&nbsp; Just as their bullets seemed to be likely to 
endanger the frightened little family, a savage-looking troop of 
natives were seen consulting, with threatening gestures aimed at 
the mission-house, and Mr. Boardman, fully expecting to be 
massacred, made his wife and her baby hide in a little shed, 
crouching to escape the bullets; but this alarm passed off, and, 
at the end of an hour, the whole of the gates had been regained 
by the Sepoys, and the attack on the magazine repulsed.&nbsp; Mr.
Boardman took this opportunity of carrying his family to the 
Government house, where they were warmly welcomed by Mrs. Burney;
but it was impossible to continue the defence of so large an 
extent as the town occupied, and therefore the tiny garrison 
decided on retiring to a large wooden building on the wharf, 
whither the Sepoys conveyed three cannon and as much powder as 
they expected to want, throwing the rest down wells.&nbsp; This 
was not done without constant skirmishing, and was not completed 
till three o&rsquo;clock, when the refugees were 
collected,&mdash;namely, a hundred Sepoys, with their wives and 
children, stripped of all their ornaments, which they had buried;
some Hindoo and Burmese servants; a few Portuguese traders; a 
wily old Mussulman; Mrs. Boardman and Mrs. Burney, each with her 
baby; and seven Englishmen besides Mr. Boardman.&nbsp; Among them
rode the ghastly figure of the sick officer, who had been taken 
from his bed, but who hoped to encourage his men by appearing on 
horseback; but his almost orange skin, wasted form, sunken eyes, 
and perfect helplessness, were to Mrs. Boardman even more 
terrible than the yells of the insurgents around and the shots of
their scanty escort.</p>
<p>Three hundred persons were crowded together in the wooden 
shed, roofed over, and supported on posts above the water, with 
no partitions.&nbsp; The situation was miserable enough, but they
trusted that the enemy, being only armed with spears, could not 
reach them.&nbsp; By and by, however, the report of a cannon 
dismayed them.&nbsp; The jingals, or small field-pieces, were 
brought up, but not till evening; and the inexperienced rebels 
took such bad aim that all the balls passed over the wharf into 
the sea, and the dense darkness put a stop to the attempt; but 
all night the trembling inmates were awakened by savage yells; 
and a Sepoy, detecting a spark of light through the chinks of the
<!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
157</span>floor, fired, and killed an enemy who had come beneath 
in a boat to set fire to the frail shelter!</p>
<p>In the morning the firing from the walls was renewed, but at 
long intervals, for there was a great scarcity of powder, though 
the unhappy besieged apprehended every moment that the right 
direction would be hit upon, and then that the balls would be 
among them.&nbsp; They could send nowhere for help, though there 
was a Chinese junk within their reach, for it could not put to 
sea under the fire of the rebels; and two more days, and two 
still more terrible nights, passed in what must have been almost 
a black hole.&nbsp; The fifth night was the worst of all, for the
town was set on fire around, and by the light of the flames the 
enemy made a furious attack; but just in time to prevent the fire
from attaining the frail wooden structure, a providential storm 
quenched it, and the muskets of the Sepoys again repulsed the 
enemy.&nbsp; By this time the provisions were all but exhausted, 
and there were few among even the defenders who were not 
seriously ill from the alternate burning sun and drenching 
rain.&nbsp; Death seemed hovering over the devoted wharf from 
every quarter; when at last, soon after sunrise on the fifth day,
the young doctor quietly beckoned the Colonel&rsquo;s wife to the
door that opened upon the sea, and pointed to the horizon, where 
a little cloudy thread of smoke was rising.</p>
<p>It was the steamer bringing Colonel Burney back, in perfect 
ignorance of the peril of Tavoy and of his wife!&nbsp; But he 
understood all at a glance.&nbsp; The women and children were 
instantly transferred to the steamer, and she was sent back to 
Moulmein, but Colonel Burney and the few men who came with him 
landed, and restored courage and spirit to the besieged.&nbsp; 
Not only was a breastwork thrown up to protect the wharf, but the
Colonel led a trusty little band of Sepoys to the wall where the 
cannon stood, recaptured them, and had absolutely regained Tavoy 
before the tidings of the insurrection had reached 
Moulmein.&nbsp; Mrs. Burney&rsquo;s babe died soon after the 
steamer had brought the two mothers and their infants to their 
refuge; but little George Boardman did not suffer any ill effects
from these dreadful days and nights, and was, in fact, the only 
child of his patents who outlived infancy.&nbsp; Another son, 
born a few months afterwards, soon ended a feeble existence, and 
Mrs. Boardman was ill for many months.&nbsp; Her husband, 
delicate from the first, never entirely recovered the sufferings 
at the wharf; yet in spite <!-- page 158--><a 
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>of an 
affection of the lungs, he would often walk twenty miles a day 
through the Karen villages, teaching and preaching, and at night 
have no food but rice, and sleep on a mat on the floor of an open
zayat.</p>
<p>The Moulmein station was a comparative rest, and the husband 
and wife removed thither to supply the place of Judson and of the
Wades, who were making another attempt upon Burmah Proper; the 
Wades taking up their residence at Rangoon, and Judson going on 
to Prome, the ancient capital, where he preached in the zayats, 
distributed tracts, and argued with the teachers in his old 
fashion; but the Ava Government had become far more suspicious, 
and interfered as soon as he began to make anything like 
progress, requesting the English officer now in residence at the 
Court to remonstrate with him, and desire him not to proceed 
further than Rangoon.&nbsp; He was obliged to yield, and again to
float down the river in his little boat, baffled, but patient and
hopeful.</p>
<p>A great change had come upon the bright, enthusiastic, lively 
young man who had set out, with his beautiful Ann, to explore the
unknown Eastern world.&nbsp; Suffering of body had not altered 
him so much as bereavement, and bereavement without rest in which
to face and recover the shock.&nbsp; A strong ascetic spirit was 
growing on him.&nbsp; Already on his first return to Moulmein, 
after joining in the embassy, he had thought it right to cut 
short the ordinary intercourse of society, to which his residence
in the camp had given rise, and had announced his intention in a 
letter to Sir Archibald Campbell.&nbsp; He was much regretted, 
for he was a particularly agreeable man; and it is evident, both 
from all testimony and from the lively tone of his letters, that 
he was full of good-natured sympathy, and, however sad at heart, 
was a cheerful and even merry companion.</p>
<p>But through these years, throughout constant care and 
unrelaxed activity of mind and body, his heart was aching for the
wife he had no time to mourn; and the agony thus suppressed led 
to an utter loathing for all that he thought held him back from 
perfect likeness to the glorified Saint whom he loved.&nbsp; He 
took delight in the most spiritual mystical writings he could 
find,&mdash;&agrave; Kempis, Madame Guyon, F&eacute;n&eacute;lon,
and the like,&mdash;and endeavoured to fulfil the Gospel measure 
of holiness.&nbsp; He gave up his whole patrimony to the American
Baptist Mission Board (now separate from England and Serampore), 
mortified to the very <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>utmost his fastidious delicacy by 
ministering to the most loathsome diseases; and to crush his love
of honour, he burnt a letter of thanks for his services from the 
Governor-General of India, and other documents of the same 
kind.&nbsp; He fasted severely, and having by nature a peculiar 
horror of the decay and mouldering of death, he deemed it pride 
and self-love, and dug a grave beside which he would sit 
meditating on the appearance of the body after death.&nbsp; He 
had a bamboo hermitage on the borders of the jungle, where he 
would live on rice for weeks together&mdash;only holding converse
with those who came to him for religious instruction; and once, 
when worn out with his work of translation, he went far into the 
depths of the wildest jungle, near a deserted pagoda, and there 
sat down to read, pray, and meditate.&nbsp; The next day, on 
returning to the spot, he found a seat of bamboo, and the 
branches woven together for a shelter.&nbsp; Judson never learnt 
whose work this was, but it was done by a loving disciple, who 
had overcome the fear of tigers to provide by night for his 
comfort, though the place was thought so dangerous that his 
safety, during the forty days that he haunted it, was viewed by 
the natives as a miracle.&nbsp; He spent several months in 
retirement.&nbsp; It was indeed four years after his bereavement,
but it is plain that he was taking the needful rest and calm that
his whole nature required after the shock that he had undergone, 
but which he had in a manner deferred until the numbers of 
workers were so increased that his constant labour could be 
dispensed with.&nbsp; He came forth from his retirement renovated
in spirit, for the second period of his toils.</p>
<p>Meantime, the Boardmans had returned to Tavoy, where they were
eagerly welcomed by their Karen flock, and found many candidates 
for baptism.&nbsp; Weak as he was, Mr. Boardman examined 
them.&nbsp; He was sometimes able to sit up in his chair and 
speak for himself, but oftener so weak that his wife sat on his 
couch and interpreted his feeble whispers; but he was so happy 
that tears of joy often filled his eyes.&nbsp; The actual 
baptism, performed by going down into the water like Philip with 
the Ethiopian, could hardly have been carried out by a man in his
state; but Moung Ing, who had been admitted to the pastorate, 
touched at Moulmein, on a mission to Mergui, and undertook the 
baptisms.&nbsp; The Karens carried Mr. Boardman to the water in 
his cot, along a street filled with lamaseries, whence the 
yellow-clothed priests looked down in scorn, and the common <!-- 
page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
160</span>people hooted and reviled: &ldquo;See! see your 
teacher, a living man borne as if he were already dead!&rdquo; 
with still worse unfeeling taunts.&nbsp; The Christians, about 
fifty in number, reached the spot, a beautiful lake, nearly a 
mile in circumference, and bordered by green grass overshadowed 
by trees.&nbsp; There they all knelt down and prayed, and then 
Moung Ing baptized the nineteen new disciples, while the pastor 
lay pale and happy, and his wife watched him with her heart full 
of the last baptism, when it had been he who poured the water and
spoke the words.</p>
<p>Mr. Boardman lived on into the year 1831, and welcomed a new 
arrival from America, Francis Mason and his wife, on the 23rd of 
January, and a week later set out to introduce the former to the 
Karens, a band of whom had come down to convey the party.&nbsp; 
Mr. Boardman was carried on his bed, his wife in a chair, and on 
the third day they reached a spot where the Karens, of their own 
accord, had erected a bamboo chapel beside a beautiful stream 
beneath a range of mountains.&nbsp; Nearly a hundred had 
assembled there, of whom half were candidates for baptism.&nbsp; 
They cooked, ate, and slept in the open air, but they had made a 
small shed for Mr. Mason, and another for the Boardmans, too 
small to stand upright in, and so ill-enclosed as to be exposed 
to sun by day and cold air by night.</p>
<p>The sufferer rapidly became worse, but he had an ardent desire
to see this last baptism, and all the thirty-four women, who were
sufficiently prepared, were baptized in his sight, though he was 
so spent as scarcely to be able to breathe without the fan and 
smelling-bottle.&nbsp; In the evening he contrived to speak a few
words of exhortation to the disciples, and to give them each a 
tract or a portion of Scripture.&nbsp; The next morning the party
set out on their return, but in the afternoon were overtaken by a
great storm of thunder and lightning, with rain that drenched his
mattress and pillows; and when they reached a house, they found 
it belonged to heathens, who would scarcely let the strange 
teacher lie in the verandah.</p>
<p>His cot was so wet that he was forced to lie on the bamboo 
floor, and the rain continued all night.&nbsp; A boat was 
expected at twelve the next day, and it was resolved to wait for 
this, while the Tavoyans looked grimly on, and refused even to 
sell a chicken to make broth for the sick man.&nbsp; By nine 
o&rsquo;clock he was evidently dying, and the Karens rubbed his 
hands and feet as they grew cold.&nbsp; Almost immediately after 
being conveyed <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>to the boat, the last struggles came
on, and in a few minutes he had passed away.&nbsp; He was buried 
at Tavoy, beside his little Sarah; all the Europeans in the town 
attending, as well as a grateful multitude of Burmese and 
Karens.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The tree to which the frail creeper 
clung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still lifts its stately head,<br />
But he, on whom my spirit hung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is sleeping with the dead,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>wrote Sarah Boardman; and her first thought was of course to 
go home with her child, but the Masons had not learnt the 
languages, and had no experience, and, without her, there would 
be no schools, no possibility of instruction for the converts of 
either people until they could speak freely, and she therefore 
resolved not to desert her work.&nbsp; She was keeping school, 
attending to all comers, and interpreting from sunrise till ten 
o&rsquo;clock at night, besides having the care of her little 
boy, and her schools were so good that, when the British 
Government established some, orders were given for conducting 
them on the same system.</p>
<p>She tried to learn Karen, but never had time, and it was the 
less needful that a little Burmese was known to some Karens, and 
thus she could always have an interpreter.&nbsp; She sometimes 
made mission tours to keep up the spirit of the Karens till Mr. 
Mason should be qualified to come among them.&nbsp; Her little 
George was carried by her attendants, and there is a note to Mrs.
Mason, sent back from one of the stages of her journey, which 
shows what her travels must have been: &ldquo;Perhaps you had 
better send the chair, as it is convenient to be carried over the
streams when they are deep.&nbsp; You will laugh when I tell you 
that I have forded all the smaller ones.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there 
is scarcely any record of these journeys of hers, she was too 
modest and shy to dwell on what only related to herself; and 
though she several times, with the help of her Burmese 
interpreter, led the devotions of two or three hundred Karens, it
was always with a sense of reluctance, and only under 
necessity.</p>
<p>She had been a widow four years, when Adoniram Judson, who had
returned from Rangoon, and was about to take charge of the 
station at Moulmein, made her his second wife, on the 10th of 
April, 1834.&nbsp; At the same time, an opportunity offered of 
sending little George back to America for education; but year 
after year filled the house at Moulmein with other little <!-- 
page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
162</span>ones,&mdash;careful comforts, in that fatal climate, 
which had begun to tell on the health of both the parents.&nbsp; 
Pain and sorrow went for little with this devoted pair.&nbsp; To 
be as holy as the Apostles though without their power, was the 
endeavour which Judson set before himself, and the work of such a
man was one of spirit that drew all to hear and follow him.&nbsp;
The Burmese converts were numbered by hundreds, and one of the 
missionaries in the Karen country could write: &ldquo;I no longer
date from a heathen land.&nbsp; Heathenism has fled from these 
banks; I eat the rice and fruits cultivated by Christian hands, 
look on the fields of Christians, see no dwellings but those of 
Christian families.&nbsp; I am seated in the midst of a Christian
village, surrounded by a people that live as Christians, converse
as Christians, act as Christians, and, to my eyes, look like 
Christians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this, like every other popular conversion, involved many 
individual disappointments from persons not keeping up to the 
Christian standard, and from coolness setting in when the 
excitement of the change was over; and great attention had to be 
paid to rules, discipline, &amp;c., as well as to providing books
and schools.&nbsp; Judson himself had to work hard at the 
completion and correction of the Burmese Bible, to which he 
devoted himself, the more entirely because an affection of the 
throat and cough came on, and for some time prevented him from 
preaching.&nbsp; In 1839, he tried to alleviate it by a voyage to
Calcutta, where he was received by both Bishop Wilson and by the 
Marshman family at Serampore; but, as he observes, &ldquo;the 
glory of Serampore had departed,&rdquo; and his stay there must 
have been full of sad associations.&nbsp; His work upon the 
Scriptures was finished in 1840, and he then began a complete 
Burmese dictionary, while his wife was translating the 
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress; but both were completely shattered in 
health, and their children, four in number, had all been brought 
low by the hooping cough, and then by other complaints.&nbsp; A 
voyage to Calcutta was imperatively enjoined on all; but it was 
stormy and full of suffering, and soon after they arrived at 
Serampore their youngest child, little Henry, died.&nbsp; A still
further voyage was thought advisable, and the whole family went 
as far as the Isle of France, where they recovered some measure 
of health, and their toil at Moulmein was resumed.&nbsp; Four 
more years passed, three more children were born, and then the 
strength <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>that had been for nineteen years so 
severely tried, gave way, and the doctors pronounced that Sarah 
Judson&rsquo;s life could only be saved by a voyage to 
America.&nbsp; The three elder children were to go with her, but 
the three little ones were to remain, since their father only 
intended to go as far as the Isle of France, and then return to 
his labour.&nbsp; The last words she ever wrote were pencilled on
a slip of paper, intended to be given to him to comfort him at 
their farewell:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We part on this green islet, love:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou for the Eastern main,<br />
I for the setting sun, love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! when to meet again?</p>
<p>My heart is sad for thee, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For lone thy way will be;<br />
And oft thy tears will fall, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For thy children and for me.</p>
<p>The music of thy daughter&rsquo;s voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;lt miss for many a year,<br />
And the merry shout of thine elder boys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;lt list in vain to hear.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Yet my spirit clings to thine, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy soul remains with me,<br />
And oft we&rsquo;ll hold communion sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the dark and distant sea.</p>
<p>And who can paint our mutual joy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When, all our wanderings o&rsquo;er,<br />
We both shall clasp our infants three<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At home on Burmah&rsquo;s shore?</p>
<p>But higher shall our raptures glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On yon celestial plain,<br />
When the loved and parted here below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet, ne&rsquo;er to part again.</p>
<p>Then gird thine armour on, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor faint thou by the way<br />
Till Boodh shall fall, and Burmah&rsquo;s sons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall own Messiah&rsquo;s sway.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a trumpet-note for a soldier to leave after nineteen 
years service &ldquo;through peril, toil, and pain,&rdquo; 
undaunted to the last!&nbsp; For by the time the ship left the 
Isle of France, she was fading so rapidly that her husband could 
not quit her, and sailed on with her to St. Helena.&nbsp; She was
fast dying, but so composed about her children, that some one 
observed that she seemed to <!-- page 164--><a 
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>have 
forgotten the three babes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can a mother 
forget?&rdquo; was all her answer.&nbsp; She died on board the 
ship, at anchor in the bay of St. Helena, and was carried to the 
burial-ground, where all the colonial clergy in the island 
attended, and she was laid beside Mrs. Chater, the wife of that 
Serampore missionary whose expulsion had led to the first 
pioneering at Rangoon, and who had since worked in Ceylon.&nbsp; 
She was just forty-two, and died September 1st, 1845.</p>
<p>Her husband found her beautiful farewell; and, as he copied it
out, he wrote after the last verse, &ldquo;Gird thine armour 
on,&rdquo; &ldquo;And so, God willing, I will yet endeavour to 
do; and while her prostrate form finds repose on the rock of the 
ocean, and her sanctified spirit enjoys sweeter repose on the 
bosom of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, let me continue to 
toil on all my appointed time, until my change too shall 
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the evening of the day of her burial, he sailed with the 
three children, and arrived at Boston on the 15th of October, 
1845.&nbsp; He remained in his native country only nine months, 
and, if a universal welcome could have delighted him, he received
it to the utmost.&nbsp; So little did he know of his own fame, 
that, returning after thirty years, he had been in pain to know 
where to procure a night&rsquo;s lodging at Boston, whereas he 
found half the city ready to compete for the honour of receiving 
him, and every one wanted to meet him.&nbsp; Places of worship 
where he was to preach were thronged, and every public meeting 
where he was expected to speak was fully attended; but all this 
fervour of welcome was a distress to him, his affection of the 
throat made oratory painful and often impossible, and the mere 
going silently to an evening assembly so excited his nerves that 
he could not sleep for the whole night after.&nbsp; Any sort of 
display was misery to him; he could not bear to sit still and 
hear the usual laudation of his achievements; and, when 
distinguished and excellent men were introduced to him, he 
received them with chilling shyness and coldness, too humble to 
believe that it was for his goodness and greatness that they 
sought to know him, but fancying it was out of mere 
curiosity.</p>
<p>His whole desire was to get back to his work and escape from 
American notoriety, and, disregarding all representations that 
longer residence in the north might confirm his health, he 
intended to seize the first opportunity of returning to 
Moulmein.&nbsp; But a wife was almost a necessity both to himself
and his <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>mission, and even now, at his mature
age and broken health, he was able to win a woman of qualities 
almost if not quite equal to those of the Ann and Sarah who had 
gone before her.</p>
<p>Emily Chubbuck, born in 1817, was the daughter of parents of 
the Baptist persuasion, living in the State of New York.&nbsp; 
She was the fifth child of a large family in such poor 
circumstances that, when she was only eleven years old, she was 
sent to work at a woollen factory, where her recollections were 
only of &ldquo;noise and filth, bleeding hands and aching feet, 
and a very sad heart;&rdquo; but happily for her, the frost 
stopped the works during the winter months, and she was able to 
go to school; and, after two years, the family removed to a 
country farm.&nbsp; They were all very delicate, and her elder 
sisters were one after the other slowly dying of decline.&nbsp; 
This, with their &ldquo;conversions&rdquo; and baptisms, deepened
Emily&rsquo;s longing to give the tokens required by her sect for
Christian membership, but they came slowly and tardily with her, 
and she quaintly told how one day she was addressed by one of the
congregation whose prayers had been asked for her, &ldquo;What! 
this little girl not converted yet?&nbsp; How do you suppose we 
can waste any more time in praying for you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her 
intelligence was very great, and in 1832, when her mother wanted 
her to become a milliner, she entreated to be allowed to engage 
herself as a school teacher.&nbsp; &ldquo;I stood as tall as I 
could,&rdquo; she says, when she went to offer herself, and she 
was accepted, although only fifteen.&nbsp; The system was that of
&ldquo;boarding round&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the young mistress
had to live a week alternately at each house, and went from 
thence to her school, but she found this so uncomfortable that 
she ended by sleeping at home every night.&nbsp; She struggled 
on, teaching in various schools, doing needlework in after-hours,
trying to improve herself, and always contending with great 
delicacy of health, which must have made it most trying to cope 
with what she calls in one of her letters &ldquo;a little 
regiment of wild cats&rdquo; for about seven years, when some of 
the friends she had made obtained of two sisters who kept a 
boarding school at Utica that she should be admitted there to 
pursue the higher branches of study for a year or two, and then 
to repay them by her services as a teacher.</p>
<p>The two ladies, Miss Urania and Miss Cynthia Sheldon, and 
their widowed sister, Mrs. Anable, proved Emily&rsquo;s kindest 
friends, and made a thoroughly happy home for her.&nbsp; She was 
<!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
166</span>very frail and nervous, but of great power of 
influence, and even while still only a pupil had this gift.&nbsp;
Here she spent the rest of her maiden days, and here she supplied
the failure of her labours in needlework by contributions to 
magazines, generally under the <i>nom de plume</i> of Fanny 
Forester.&nbsp; They were chiefly poems and short tales, and were
popular enough to bring in a sum that was very important to the 
Chubbuck family.&nbsp; The day&rsquo;s employment was very full, 
and she stole the time required from her rest.&nbsp; Late one 
night, Miss Sheldon seeing a light in the room looked in, and 
found her trembling in nervous agitation, holding her head with 
her hands and her manuscript before her; and when gently rebuked,
and entreated to lie down at once, she exclaimed with a burst of 
tears, &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Miss Urania, I must write; I must help my
poor parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brave and dutiful endeavours prospered so much that she 
was actually able to buy a house for them.&nbsp; It was during 
her stay at Utica that she was baptized, and several of her 
writings were expressly for the Baptist Sunday School Union; and 
though others were of a more secular cast, all were such as could
only be composed by a religious woman.&nbsp; A little book of 
hers fell into the hands of Dr. Judson, and struck him so much 
that he said, &ldquo;I should be glad to know her.&nbsp; A lady 
who writes so well ought to write better.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was 
then at Philadelphia, and at the moment of his introduction to 
her was undergoing the process of vaccination.&nbsp; As soon as 
it was over he entered into conversation with her with some 
abruptness, demanding of her how she could employ her talents in 
writings so trifling and so little spiritual as those he had 
read.</p>
<p>Emily met the rebuke without offence, but defended herself by 
describing the necessity of her case, with her indigent parents 
depending upon her; so that her work must almost of necessity be 
popular and profitable, though, as a duty, she avoided all that 
could be of doubtful tendency.</p>
<p>The missionary was thoroughly softened, and not only acquitted
her, but begged her to undertake the biography of his wife Sarah:
and this threw them much together.&nbsp; He was fifty-seven, she 
twenty-eight, when he offered himself to her in the following 
letter, sent with a watch:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hand you, dearest, a charmed watch.&nbsp; It always 
comes back to me, and brings its wearer with it.&nbsp; I gave it 
to Ann when a hemisphere divided us, and it brought her safely 
and <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>surely to my arms.&nbsp; I gave it 
to Sarah during her husband&rsquo;s lifetime (not then aware of 
the secret), and the charm, though slow in its operation, was 
true at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The charm worked.&nbsp; Emily Chubbuck was ready to follow Dr.
Judson to the deadly climate of Burmah, to share his labours, and
become a mother to the babies he had left there.</p>
<p>They were married on the 2nd of June, 1846, and five weeks 
later sailed for Burmah, leaving the three children at 
school.</p>
<p>Emily seems to have differed from Ann and Sarah, in that she 
had less actual missionary zeal than they.&nbsp; Sarah at least 
was a missionary in heart, and, as such, became a wife; but Emily
was more the wife, working as her husband worked.&nbsp; She had 
much more literary power than either; her letters to her friends 
were full of vivid description, playful accounts of their 
adventures, and lively colouring even of misfortunes, pain, and 
sickness.&nbsp; She arrived at Moulmein in November.&nbsp; One 
little boy had died during Dr. Judson&rsquo;s absence, but the 
other two were tenderly cared for by the new Mrs. Judson, who 
threw herself into all the work and interests of the mission with
great animation.&nbsp; It proved, however, that both the Burman 
and Karen missions were well supplied with teachers; and Dr. 
Judson thought he should be more useful at Rangoon, where there 
had, since one attempt on the part of the Wades, been no resident
missionary.&nbsp; He heard accounts of the Court which made him 
hope to recover a footing at Ava, and decided on again living at 
Rangoon; but he soon heard that there was less hope than ever at 
Ava.&nbsp; The king whom he had known was dead, and had been 
succeeded by a devoted Buddhist, whose brother and heir, 
&ldquo;having been prevented from being a lama,&rdquo; writes Dr.
Judson, &ldquo;poor man! does all that he can.&nbsp; He descends 
from his prince-regal seat, pounds and winnows the rice with his 
own hands, washes and boils it in his own cook-house, and then, 
on bended knees, presents it to the priests.&nbsp; This strong 
pulsation at the heart has thrown fresh blood through the once 
shrivelled system of the national superstition, and now every one
vies with his neighbour in building pagodas and making offerings 
to the priests.&nbsp; What can one poor missionary effect, 
accompanied by his yet speechless wife, and followed by three men
and one woman from Moulmein, and summoning to his aid the aged 
pastor of Rangoon and eight or ten surviving members of the 
church?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>The Vice-governor, or Raywoon, was a violent and cruel 
savage, whose house and court-yard rang with shrieks from the 
tortured, and the old remnant of Christians were sadly 
scattered.&nbsp; When they were collected to worship on Sunday, 
they durst not either come in or go out in company, and used to 
arrive with their garments tucked up to look like Coolies, or 
carrying fruit or parcels, while the Karens crept down from the 
hills in small parties.&nbsp; The Governor was friendly, but a 
weak man, whose authority the Raywoon openly set at defiance; and
all sorts of petty annoyances were set in action against the 
teachers, while the probability that the converts would suffer 
actual persecution daily increased.&nbsp; Dr. Judson used to call
the present difficulties the Splugen Pass, and illness, of 
course, added to their troubles.</p>
<p>The great Buddhist fast of the year had never before been 
imposed on strangers, but now the markets contained nothing but 
boiled rice, fruit, or decaying fish, and terrible illness was 
the consequence both with themselves and the children, until some
boxes of biscuit arrived from Moulmein, and a Mahometan was 
bribed to supply fowls.</p>
<p>But the finances of the Society at home were at a low ebb, and
it was thought needful to diminish the number of stations.&nbsp; 
The intolerance of the Burmese Government led to the decision 
that there was less benefit in maintaining that at Rangoon than 
those in the British provinces; and, as Dr. Judson had no private
means, he was obliged to obey and return to Moulmein.&nbsp; Here 
he had a curious correspondence with the Prince of Siam, whose 
letter began in his own English: &ldquo;Venerable sir, having 
received very often your far-famed qualities, honesty, 
faithfulness, righteousness, gracefulness, and very kindness to 
poor nation, &amp;c., from reading the book of your ancient 
wife&rsquo;s memoir and journal.&rdquo; . . . The object of this 
letter was to ask for some of his Burmese translations, and, in 
return for them, his Royal Highness sent &ldquo;a few artificial 
flowers, two passion flowers, one mognayet or surnamed flower, 
and three roses manufactured by most celebrated princess the 
daughter of the late second king or sub-king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dictionary continued to be Judson&rsquo;s chief 
occupation, for his affection of the voice rendered him unable to
take charge of a congregation.&nbsp; He continued to work at it 
till the November of 1849, when he caught a severe cold, which 
<!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
169</span>brought on an attack of fever, and from that time he 
never entirely rallied.</p>
<p>One of the last pleasures of his life deserves to be 
mentioned.&nbsp; He had always had a strong feeling for the Jews,
and had longed to work for their conversion, praying that he 
might at least do something towards it.&nbsp; After his last 
illness had begun, a letter was read to him by his wife, giving 
an account of a German Jew who had been led, by reading the 
history of his toils in Burmah in the Gospel cause, to study 
Christianity and believe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; he said 
presently, his eyes full of tears, &ldquo;this frightens 
me.&nbsp; I do not know what to make of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What you have just been 
reading.&nbsp; I never was deeply interested in any object; I 
never prayed sincerely and fervently for anything, but it came at
some time&mdash;no matter how distant a day&mdash;somehow, in 
some shape, probably the last I should have devised, it 
came.&nbsp; And yet I have always had so little faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After spending a month at Amherst in the vain hope of 
improvement, a sea-voyage was recommended; but his reluctance was
great, for his wife was expecting a second child, and could not 
go with him.&nbsp; There are some lines of hers describing her 
night-watches, so exquisite and descriptive, that we must 
transcribe them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sleep, love, sleep!<br />
The dusty day is done.<br />
Lo! from afar the freshening breezes sweep<br />
Wide over groves of balm,<br />
Down from the towering palm,<br />
In at the open casement cooling run;<br />
And round thy lowly bed,<br />
Thy bed of pain,<br />
Bathing thy patient head,<br />
Like grateful showers of rain<br />
They come;<br />
While the white curtains, waving to and fro,<br />
Fan the sick air;<br />
And pityingly the shadows come and go,<br />
With gentle human care,<br />
Compassionate and dumb.<br />
The dusty day is done,<br />
The night begun;<br />
While prayerful watch I keep,<br />
Sleep, love, sleep!<br />
Is there no magic in the touch<br />
Of fingers thou dost love so much?<br />
Fain would they scatter poppies o&rsquo;er thee now;<br />
<!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
170</span>Or, with its mute caress,<br />
The tremulous lip some soft nepenthe press<br />
Upon thy weary lid and aching brow;<br />
While prayerful watch I keep,<br />
Sleep, love, sleep!</p>
<p>On the pagoda spire<br />
The bells are swinging,<br />
Their little golden circlet in a flutter<br />
With tales the wooing winds have dared to utter,<br />
Till all are ringing,<br />
As if a choir<br />
Of golden-nested birds in heaven were singing;<br />
And with a lulling sound<br />
The music floats around,<br />
And drops like balm into the drowsy ear;<br />
Commingling with the hum<br />
Of the Sepoy&rsquo;s distant drum,<br />
And lazy beetle ever droning near.<br />
Sounds these of deepest silence born,<br />
Like night made visible by morn;<br />
So silent that I sometimes start<br />
To hear the throbbings of my heart,<br />
And watch, with shivering sense of pain,<br />
To see thy pale lids lift again.</p>
<p>The lizard, with his mouse-like eyes,<br />
Peeps from the mortise in surprise<br />
At such strange quiet after day&rsquo;s hard din;<br />
Then boldly ventures out,<br />
And looks around,<br />
And with his hollow feet<br />
Treads his small evening beat,<br />
Darting upon his prey<br />
In such a tricksy, winsome sort of way,<br />
His delicate marauding seems no sin.<br />
And still the curtains swing,<br />
But noiselessly;<br />
The bells a melancholy murmur ring,<br />
As tears were in the sky:<br />
More heavily the shadows fall,<br />
Like the black foldings of a pall,<br />
Where juts the rough beam from the wall;<br />
The candles flare<br />
With fresher gusts of air;<br />
The beetle&rsquo;s drone<br />
Turns to a dirge-like, solitary moan;<br />
Night deepens, and I sit, in cheerless doubt, alone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In spite of all this tender care, Dr. Judson became so much 
worse that, as a last resource, a passage was taken for him and 
<!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
171</span>another missionary, named Ramney, on board a French 
vessel bound for the Isle of Bourbon.&nbsp; The outset of the 
voyage was very rough, and this produced such an increase of 
illness, that his life closed on the 12th of April, 1850, only a 
fortnight after parting from his wife, though it was not for four
months that she could be informed of his loss.&nbsp; During this 
time she had given birth to a dead babe, and had suffered 
fearfully from sorrow and suspense.</p>
<p>She had become valuable enough to the mission for there to be 
much anxiety to retain her, and at first she thought of 
remaining; but her health was too much broken, and in a few 
months she carried home her little girl and her two 
step-sons.&nbsp; She collected the family together, and spent her
time in the care of them, and in contributing materials for the 
Life of her husband; but the hereditary disease of her family had
already laid its grasp on her, and she died on the 1st of June, 
1854, the last of a truly devoted group of workers, as remarkable
for their cheerfulness as for their heroism.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; THE BISHOPRIC OF CALCUTTA: THOMAS 
MIDDLETON, REGINALD HEBER, DANIEL WILSON.</h2>
<p>Perhaps dying in a cause is the surest way of leading to its 
success.&nbsp; Henry Martyn was sinking on his homeward journey, 
while in England the renewal of the Charter of the East India 
Company was leading to the renewal of those discussions on the 
promotion of religion in Hindostan which had been so entirely 
quashed twenty years before, in 1793.&nbsp; Claudius Buchanan had
published his &ldquo;Christian Researches,&rdquo; the Life of 
Schwartz had become known, the labours of Marshman and Carey were
reported, and the Legislature at length attended to the 
representations, made through Archbishop Manners Sutton, by the 
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and consented to 
sanction the establishment of a branch of the Church, with a 
Bishop to govern it at Calcutta, and an Archdeacon there <!-- 
page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
172</span>and also at Madras and Bombay; the Bishop to have 
5,000<i>l.</i> a year but no house, and each Archdeacon 
2,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; Such was all that the efforts of Wilberforce
could wring from the East India Company for a diocese, in length 
twenty degrees, in breadth ten, and where the inconvenience of 
distances was infinitely increased by the difficulties and 
dangers of travelling.</p>
<p>One excuse for the insufficiency of this provision had more 
weight with the supporters of the Church than we can 
understand.&nbsp; England had for more than a thousand years been
accustomed to connect temporal grandeur with the Episcopacy; a 
Bishop not in the House of Lords seemed an anomaly, and it was 
imagined that to create chief pastors without a considerable 
endowment would serve to bring them into contempt; whereas to 
many minds, that very wealth and station was an absolute 
stumbling-block.&nbsp; However, a beginning was made, and a year 
after Henry Martyn&rsquo;s death, in 1814, the first of the 
Colonial Bishops of England was appointed, namely, Thomas Fanshaw
Middleton, the son of a Derbyshire clergyman, who had been 
educated at Christ&rsquo;s Hospital, and Pembroke College, 
Cambridge, and had since been known as an excellent Greek 
scholar, and an active clergyman in the diocese of Lincoln.&nbsp;
Thence he removed to the rectory of St. Pancras, London, where he
strove hard to accomplish the building of a new church, but could
not succeed, such was the dead indifference of the period.&nbsp; 
He was also Archdeacon of Huntingdon, and one of a firmly 
compacted body of friends who were doing much in a resolute 
though quiet way for the awakening of the nation from its apathy 
towards religion.&nbsp; Joshua Watson, a merchant, might be 
regarded as the lay-manager and leader, as having more leisure, 
and more habit of business than the clergy, with and for whom he 
worked.&nbsp; This is no place for detailing their home labours, 
but it may be well to mention that to their exertions we owe the 
National Society for the education of the poor, and likewise that
edition of the Holy Scriptures, with notes, which is commonly 
known as Mant&rsquo;s Bible.&nbsp; They were the chief managers 
at that time of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; 
and when, in 1813, a Danish missionary was sent out by that 
Society to take charge of the congregations left by Schwartz and 
his colleagues, it was Archdeacon Middleton who was selected to 
deliver a charge to him.&nbsp; It was a very powerful and 
impressive speech, and perhaps <!-- page 173--><a 
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>occasioned 
Dr. Tomline, Bishop of Lincoln, to recommend the speaker to the 
Earl of Buckinghamshire for the bishopric created the next 
year.</p>
<p>The office would be, humanly speaking, most trying, laborious 
and perplexing, and neither Archdeacon Middleton&rsquo;s age 
(forty-five) nor his habits inclined to enthusiasm.&nbsp; He 
shrank from it at first, then &ldquo;suspected,&rdquo; as he 
says, &ldquo;that I had yielded to some unmanly 
considerations,&rdquo; and decided that it was his duty to accept
the charge as a call from his Master.&nbsp; He was consecrated in
the chapel at Lambeth, by Archbishop Manners Sutton, with the 
Bishops of London, Lincoln, and Salisbury assisting.&nbsp; The 
sermon was preached by Dr. Rennell, Dean of Winchester, but was 
withheld from publication for the strange reason that there was 
so strong an aversion to the establishment of episcopacy in 
India, that it was thought better not to attract attention to the
fact that had just been accomplished.</p>
<p>Bishop Middleton, his wife, and two of his Archdeacons (the 
third was already in India) sailed on the 8th of June, 1814, and 
they landed at Calcutta on the 28th of November.&nbsp; There was 
no public reception, for fear of alarming the natives, though, on
the other hand, they were found to entertain a better opinion of 
the English on finding they respected their own religion.&nbsp; 
The difficulties of the Bishop&rsquo;s arrival were increased by 
the absence of Lord Moira, the Governor-General, who was engaged 
in the Nepaulese war; and as no house had been provided for the 
Bishop, he had to be the guest of Mr. Seton, a member of the 
Council, till a house could be procured, at a high rent.</p>
<p>One of the first visitors was a Hindoo gentleman, who told 
him, &ldquo;Sir William Jones was a great man and understood our 
books, but he attended only to our law.&nbsp; Your lordship will 
study our religion; your people mistake our religion; it is not 
in our books.&nbsp; The Brahminee religion and your 
lordship&rsquo;s are the same; we mean the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man seems to have been one of those of whom there are now 
only too many in India, who have thrown off their old 
superstitions only to believe in nothing, save the existence of a
Supreme Being, and who fancy that all other religions can be 
simplified into the like.&nbsp; This is the class that has, for 
the seventy years during which Christianity has been preached in 
earnest, been the alternate hope and anxiety of the missionary; 
intellectually renouncing their own paganism, but withheld by 
<!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
174</span>the prejudices of their families from giving up the 
heathenish customs of caste; admiring divine morality, but not 
perceiving the inability of man to attain the standard; and 
refusing to accept the mysteries in the supernatural portion of 
Revelation.&nbsp; Such was probably Serfojee; such was the 
celebrated Brahmin Ram Mohun Roy, with whom Bishop Middleton had 
much discussion, and of whom he had at one time many hopes, a man
of very remarkable powers of mind and clear practical 
intelligence.&nbsp; Roy&rsquo;s endeavour at first was to purify 
the native forms of religion, and, recurring to the Vedas, to 
find a high philosophy in them; but he and the friends he 
gathered round him soon became convinced that these contained no 
system of reasonable theology, still less of morality, and they 
then constructed for themselves a theory culled from 
Christianity, but rejecting whatever did not approve itself to 
their intellect, in especial the holy mysteries regarding the 
nature of the Godhead and the Incarnation of our Lord.&nbsp; This
teaching, called Brahmoism, from Brahma, the purest and highest 
of Hindoo divinities, is, under another form, the Neo-Platonism 
of the Greeks, or the Soofeeism of the Persians.&nbsp; There was 
even the germ of it in the grotesque medicine-man encountered by 
David Brainerd.&nbsp; It is the form of opposition which the 
spirit of evil always stirs up, wherever the natural character is
elevated enough to appreciate the beauty of Christian 
morality.&nbsp; It only prevails where there are refined and 
cultivated men, afraid of all belief in the supernatural, as a 
humbling of their intellect to superstition; and just at present 
a form of it is very prevalent in India, owing to the amount of 
education which the natives receive, which uproots the old 
belief, but does not always implant the new.&nbsp; Whether it 
will become a stepping-stone to Christianity, or whether it has 
substance to become a separate sect, remains to be proved.</p>
<p>To return to Bishop Middleton.&nbsp; He knew when he left home
that his work would be heavy, and that to set in order the things
that were wanting must be his first undertaking; but no words 
could have conveyed the dead weight of care and toil that lay on 
him.&nbsp; The huge diocese was shamefully deficient in all that 
was needful for the keeping up of religious ordinances; the 
Company&rsquo;s chaplains, few in number, were stationed at 
immense distances apart, and for the most part had no attempt at 
a proper church for their congregations.&nbsp; Verandahs or <!-- 
page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
175</span>dining-rooms were used on Sundays; and at Meerut, an 
edifice was actually built for the purpose of a riding-school in 
the week, and a place of worship on Sunday.&nbsp; Moreover, these
chaplains were accustomed to look to the Governor-General as 
their only superior, and, living so far apart, each followed his 
own independent line of action, as if entirely 
unaccountable.&nbsp; Some, such as Mr. Corrie at Cawnpore, were 
admirable and earnest men; but Henry Martyn&rsquo;s successor at 
Dinapore had let the place sink into a lamentable state, and 
there were several chaplains who greatly resented the being 
brought under authority.&nbsp; The brunt of the battle fell of 
course upon the first Bishop, and being a man as sensitive as he 
was firm, it tried him severely.&nbsp; His entreaty was 
constantly for more men; and in order to obtain a ministry beyond
that which the East India Company would provide for, he occupied 
himself in procuring the foundation of Bishop&rsquo;s College, 
close to Calcutta, a seminary where young men, both European and 
native, could receive a good theological and classical education,
and be prepared for Holy Orders.&nbsp; The Society for Promoting 
Christian Knowledge granted 5,000<i>l.</i> for the purpose, and 
private subscriptions came in, until on the 15th of December, 
1820, the Bishop was enabled to lay the foundation-stone of an 
institution that has, now for half a century, admirably answered 
its purpose.</p>
<p>It has long been found that Christianity cannot take root 
without a native ministry, and Bishop Middleton was most anxious 
to ordain such catechists of Schwartz&rsquo;s training as were 
ready; but he found great technical difficulties in the way, 
since the ordination form in the Prayer Book left no opening for 
persons who, not being British subjects, could not be expected to
take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy; and, moreover, it was
not certain what language ought to be used with men not speaking 
English.&nbsp; The arrangement of these difficulties hindered him
from ordaining Christian David, the godson and pupil of Schwartz,
and a subject of Tanjore, on his visitation to the 
Presidency.&nbsp; This good man met him, together with the 
minister of Palamcotta, bringing a deputation about thirty in 
number.&nbsp; The minister was an exceedingly dark man, with a 
very interesting countenance.&nbsp; Addresses, interpreted by 
Christian, were made on either side, and the thirty sang a psalm 
of thanksgiving in Tamul.&nbsp; They were only a small 
deputation, for there were several Christian villages in 
Tinnevelly, <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>with churches built of unburnt 
brick, and roofed with palmyra leaves, where the English Liturgy 
was used, having been translated into Tamul by David.</p>
<p>At Tanjore, the Bishop was received in the most friendly 
manner by Serfojee, who came down from his throne to welcome him,
and caused Mrs. Middleton to be conducted to visit the ladies of 
his zenana.&nbsp; He conducted the Bishop into his library, which
contained books in various European languages; also on medicine 
and anatomy, this being his favourite study, to assist him in 
which he had an ivory skeleton.&nbsp; He returned the visit in 
great state, with six elephants, two of enormous size, going 
before him, and accompanied by his troops, with a wild, horrid 
dissonance of cannon and native music.&nbsp; Two thousand persons
escorted the Rajah to the Bishop&rsquo;s tent, where he conversed
very sensibly on various subjects, especially English history, or
as he called it, &ldquo;the Generations of English 
Kings.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was keeping up the good works he had 
established, under the encouragement of the British resident, 
Colonel Blackburne, and in this district the native Christians 
numbered about 500, who were under the direction of 
Schwartz&rsquo;s companion, Pohl&eacute;.</p>
<p>On the Malabar coast Bishop Middleton had much intercourse 
with the Christians of St. Thomas, visited their churches, and 
held much conversation with their Bishop, convincing himself that
the distinctive tenets of Nestorianism had died out among them, 
and arranging for their receiving assistance in books and 
teachers.</p>
<p>His visit to Ceylon followed, and was always regarded by him 
as a time of much gratification; the good Governor, Sir Robert 
Brownrigg, had done so much for the improvement of the people, 
and the missions were flourishing so well.&nbsp; Here Christian 
David became a catechist, and on the Bishop&rsquo;s second 
visitation, in 1821, he ordained as deacon a man named Armour, 
whose history one longs to know more fully.&nbsp; He had come out
to Ceylon originally as a private soldier, and finding a number 
of natives, probably the remnant of the Dutch Mission, whose 
profession of Christianity was only nominal, he had taken upon 
himself &ldquo;almost the work of an evangelist,&rdquo; never 
varying from the teaching and services of the English 
Church.&nbsp; He had taught himself to speak and preach fluently 
in Cingalese, and could use the Dutch and Portuguese languages 
freely.&nbsp; He had <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>even some knowledge of Latin and 
Greek, and was so staunch Churchman that he had resisted all 
invitations from the Baptists to join them.&nbsp; He had gone 
through frightful difficulties and dangers in the swamp and the 
jungle, and travelled thousands of miles; and when he came to the
Bishop it was with deep humility, and the hope that he had not 
been presumptuous in taking on himself the charge of souls 
without sanction.&nbsp; It was his great desire to obtain this 
commission, and the Bishop, finding how sound in faith, pious, 
and excellent he was, admitted him to deacon&rsquo;s orders 
before leaving Colombo.</p>
<p>Ceylon was erected into an archdeaconry and attached to the 
Bishopric of Calcutta, and shortly after the same arrangement was
made respecting Australia&mdash;an archdeaconry a great deal 
larger than the continent of Europe!&nbsp; Thence Bishop 
Middleton received and attended to the petition of the Rev. 
Samuel Marsden, a devoted worker in the vineyard, of whom our 
next chapter will speak.</p>
<p>Distinct missionary labour was scarcely possible to a man 
overtasked like Bishop Middleton.&nbsp; The district that kept 
St. Paul in continual &ldquo;journeyings often&rdquo; would have 
been but a quarter of that which depended on him for &ldquo;the 
care of all the churches,&rdquo; and the long journeys by sea and
land were by far the least harassing part of his life; for he had
to fight the battles, sometimes of his Church, sometimes of the 
whole Christian cause, with unfair and prejudiced officials, and 
a malignant newspaper press, by which the bitterest attacks were 
circulated against him and his doings.&nbsp; And, &ldquo;besides 
those things that were without,&rdquo; there were the troubles of
dealing with men used to do &ldquo;that which was right in their 
own eyes,&rdquo; and determined to oppose or neglect one whose 
powers could only thoroughly be defined by actual practice.&nbsp;
To go into these conflicts would be wearisome and vain.&nbsp; 
They have lost their interest now; but it must be remembered that
it is by manfully and firmly enduring vexations such as these, 
that systems are established which form the framework and 
foundation of more visible labours, which gain more praise for 
those who are allowed to carry them out.</p>
<p>The constant wearing effort, the daily vexation, the inability
to gain support, the binding of his hands from free action by the
machinery of State regulations only applicable to home <!-- page 
178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
178</span>ecclesiastics, the continual making beginnings that 
never were allowed to progress&mdash;or, as he himself called it,
the continual rolling of the stone of Sisyphus&mdash;could not 
but exhaust his powers, above all in such a climate; and that 
same sickly summer of 1822 which proved fatal to Felix Carey was 
his last.&nbsp; In July, one of his clergy, on whom he had been 
obliged to pass censure, instituted proceedings against him in 
the Supreme Court&mdash;a most improper and disloyal act, which 
much grieved and agitated him.&nbsp; He had to spend eight hours 
in writing in preparation for this painful matter, and afterwards
went out in the carriage with his wife, but too early in the 
evening, for the slanting rays of the sun, not yet down, fell 
full on him, and their force is always especially dreaded at that
damp and sickly season.&nbsp; He immediately said that the sun 
had struck him, and returned home; a most distressing fever, 
chiefly on the nerves, and accompanied by grievous restlessness 
and afterwards delirium, set in, and he died on the 8th of July, 
1822, in his fifty-fourth year, absolutely worn out by toil and 
worry.&nbsp; But his career had established both the needfulness 
and the position of a Bishop, and his successor was appointed 
without the same opposition, still to a path perhaps only less 
thorny because briefer.</p>
<p>Of a Yorkshire family, where the eldest son was always bred up
as the country gentleman, the younger ones usually prepared to 
hold the family livings, Reginald Heber was born on the 21st of 
April, 1783, at Malpas, in Cheshire, a rectory held by his 
father, who was the clerical second son, but soon after became 
head of the house by the death of his squire-brother.&nbsp; He 
was twice married, and had a son by his first wife, so that 
Reginald was born, as it were, to the prospect of taking Holy 
Orders; and this fact seems to have in a certain degree coloured 
his whole boyhood, and acted as a consecration, not saddening, 
but brightening his life.</p>
<p>A happy, eager, docile childhood seems to have been his; so 
obedient, that when an attack on the lungs necessitated the use 
of very painful remedies, the physician said that the chances of 
his recovery turned upon his being the most tractable of 
children; and with such a love and knowledge of the Bible that, 
when only five years old, his father could consult him like a 
little Concordance, and withal full of boyish mirth and 
daring.&nbsp; When sent to school at Neasdon, he was so excited 
by the story <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>of an African traveller overawing a 
wild bull by the calm defiance of the eye, as to attempt the like
process upon one that he found grazing in a field, but without 
the like success; for he provoked so furious a charge that he was
forced to escape ignominiously over a high paling, whence he 
descended into a muddy pond.</p>
<p>Neasdon was the place of education of his whole boyhood, among
twelve other pupils.&nbsp; Mr. John Thornton, the schoolfellow 
friend and correspondent of his life, describes him as having 
been much beloved there.&nbsp; He had no scruple as to fighting 
rather than submitting to tyranny from a bigger boy, but his 
unfailing good nature and unselfishness generally prevented such 
collisions; he was full of fun, and excellent at games of all 
sorts; and though at one time evil talk was prevalent among the 
boys, his perfect purity of mind and power of creating innocent 
amusement destroyed the habit, without estranging the other lads 
from him.&nbsp; He took many of his stories from books not read 
by them, for he was an omnivorous reader, taking special delight 
in poetry, loving nothing better than a solitary walk with 
Spenser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fa&euml;rie Queen&rdquo; in his hand, and 
often himself composing verses above the average for so young a 
boy.</p>
<p>He was always thoughtful, and there is a letter of his to his 
friend Thornton, written when only seventeen, which shows that he
had begun to think over Church questions, was deeply sensible of 
the sacredness of the apostolical commission to the ministry, and
of the evils of State interference.&nbsp; That same year, 1800, 
began his University education, at Brasenose College, 
Oxford.&nbsp; His course there was alike blameless in life and 
brilliant in scholarship; his talents and industry could not fail
to secure him honours in the schools.</p>
<p>Another young man was at the very same time at Oxford, whose 
course had been steered thither with more difficulties than 
Reginald Heber&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Daniel Wilson&rsquo;s father was a 
wealthy silk manufacturer, at Spitalfields, where he was born in 
the year 1778.&nbsp; He was educated at a private school at 
Hackney, kept by a clergyman named Eyre, who must have had a good
deal of discernment of character, for he said, &ldquo;There is no
milk and water in that boy.&nbsp; He will be either something 
very bad or very good.&rdquo;&nbsp; One day, when he was in an 
obstinate and impracticable state of idleness, Mr. Eyre said, 
&ldquo;Daniel, you are <!-- page 180--><a 
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>not worth 
flogging, or I would flog you,&rdquo; which so stung him that he 
never fell into similar disgrace again; nay, one morning when he 
had failed in his appointed task, he refused food saying, 
&ldquo;No!&nbsp; If my head will not work, my body shall not 
eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had considerable powers, and when his own 
theme on a given subject was finished, would find 
&ldquo;sense&rdquo; for all the dull boys&mdash;varying the 
matter but keeping to the point in all: but his education ceased 
at fourteen, when he was bound apprentice to his uncle, who 
followed the same trade as his father, and lived in 
Cheapside.&nbsp; He was a widower with seven children, one of 
whom in after years became Daniel&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; It was a 
strictly religious household, and whereas Daniel&rsquo;s parents 
had been wont to attend church or meeting as suited them best, 
his uncle was a regular churchman, and took his whole family 
constantly with him, as decidedly as he kept up discipline in his
warehouse, where the young men had so little liberty, that for 
weeks together they never had occasion to put on their hats 
except on Sunday.</p>
<p>Daniel was a thoughtless, irreverent lad, full of schoolboy 
restlessness when first he came; but though he was at first 
remarkable for his ill-behaviour in church, his attendance 
insensibly took effect upon him, as it brought his mind under the
influence of the two chief powers for good then in London, John 
Newton and Richard Cecil.&nbsp; The vehement struggle for 
conversion and sense of individual salvation that their teaching 
deemed the beginning of grace took place, and he turned for aid 
to them and to his old schoolmaster, Mr. Eyre.&nbsp; It was from 
his hands in 1797, at the age of nineteen, that he received his 
first Communion, with so much emotion and such trembling, that he
writes to his mother, &ldquo;I have no doubt I appeared very 
foolish to those about me,&rdquo; but he adds in another letter 
to a friend that it had been the happiest day of his life.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And to you I confess it,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;(though it
ought perhaps to be a cause for shame,) that I have felt great 
desire to go or do anything for the love of <span 
class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and that I have even wished, if it 
were the Lord&rsquo;s will, to go as a missionary to foreign 
lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is very remarkable that this thought should have occurred 
at such a moment to one who only became a missionary thirty-five 
years later, at a summons from without, not from within.&nbsp; 
The distinct mission impulse passed away, but a strong desire 
<!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
181</span>remained to devote himself to the ministry of the 
Church.&nbsp; He tried to stifle it at first, lest it should be a
form of conceit or pride; but it only grew upon him, and at last 
he spoke to Mr. Eyre, who promised to broach the subject to his 
parents.</p>
<p>His father was strongly averse to it, as an overthrow to all 
his plans, and Mr. Eyre, after hearing both sides, said that he 
should give no opinion for a year; it would not hurt Daniel to 
remain another year in the warehouse, to fulfil the term of his 
apprenticeship, and it would then be proper time to decide 
whether to press his father to change his mind.&nbsp; It was a 
very sore trial to the young man, who had many reasons for 
deeming this sheer waste of time, though he owned he had not lost
much of his school learning, having always loved it so much as to
read as much Latin as he could in his leisure hours.&nbsp; He 
submitted at first, but was uneasy under his submission, and 
asked counsel from all the clergymen he revered, who seem all to 
have advised <i>him</i> to be patient, but to have urged his 
father to yield, which he finally did before the year was out; so
that Daniel Wilson was entered at St. Edmund&rsquo;s Hall, 
Oxford, on the 1st of May, 1798.&nbsp; He struggled with the 
eagerness of one whose desire had grown by meeting with 
obstacles.&nbsp; In order to acquire a good Latin style, he 
translated all Cicero&rsquo;s letters into English, and then back
into Latin; and when he went up for his degree, he took, besides 
his Latin and Greek books, the whole Hebrew Bible, but was only 
examined in the Psalms.&nbsp; He gained a triumphant first-class,
and the next year, 1803, he carried off the English prose essay 
prize.&nbsp; The theme was &ldquo;Common Sense.&rdquo;&nbsp; He 
had not in the least expected to gain the prize, and had not even
mentioned the competition to his friends, so that their delight 
and surprise were equal.&nbsp; That same year, Reginald Heber was
happy in the subject for Sir Roger Newdegate&rsquo;s prize for 
English verse, namely, &ldquo;Palestine,&rdquo; which in this 
case had fallen to a poet too real to be crushed by the greatness
of his subject.</p>
<p>Reginald Heber was used to society of high talent and 
cultivation.&nbsp; His elder brother, Richard, was an elegant 
scholar and antiquary, and was intimate with Mr. Marriott, of 
Rokeby; with Mr. Surtees, the beauty of whose forged ballads 
almost makes us forgive him for having palmed them off as 
genuine; and with Walter Scott, then chiefly known as &ldquo;the 
compiler of the &lsquo;Border Minstrelsy,&rsquo;&rdquo; but who a
few years later immortalized his <!-- page 182--><a 
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>friendship 
for Richard Heber by the sixth of his introductions to 
&ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo;&mdash;the best known, as it contains the 
description of the Christmas of the olden time.&nbsp; It 
concludes with the wish&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Adieu, dear Heber, life and health!<br />
And store of literary wealth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as Reginald was finishing his prize poem, Scott was on a 
tour through England, and breakfasted at Richard Heber&rsquo;s 
rooms at Oxford, when on the way to lionize Blenheim.&nbsp; The 
young brother&rsquo;s poem was brought forward and read aloud, 
and Scott&rsquo;s opinion was anxiously looked for.&nbsp; It was 
thoroughly favourable, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; said Scott, &ldquo;you 
have missed one striking circumstance in your account of the 
building of the Temple, that no tools were used in its 
erection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the party broke up the lines had been added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No workman&rsquo;s steel, no ponderous axes
rung;<br />
Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprung;<br />
Majestic silence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prose essay on &ldquo;Common Sense&rdquo; was first 
recited from the rostrum in the Sheldonian theatre, and Wilson 
always remembered the hearty applause of the young man who sat 
waiting his turn.&nbsp; But the effect of the recitation of 
&ldquo;Palestine&rdquo; was entirely unrivalled on that as on any
other occasion.&nbsp; Reginald Heber,&mdash;a graceful, 
fine-looking, rather pale young man of twenty,&mdash;with his 
younger brother Thomas beside him as prompter, stood in the 
rostrum, and commenced in a clear, beautiful, melancholy voice, 
with perfect declamation, which overcame all the stir and 
tumultuous restlessness of the audience by the power and 
sweetness of words and action:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Reft of thy sons, amid thy foes forlorn,<br
/>
Mourn, widow&rsquo;d queen; forgotten Zion, mourn.<br />
Is this thy place, sad city, this thy throne,<br />
Where the wild desert rears its craggy stone;<br />
While suns unblest their angry lustre fling,<br />
And wayworn pilgrims seek the scanty spring?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On flowed the harmonious lines, looking back to the call of 
the Chosen, the victory of Joshua, the glory of Solomon, the 
hidden glory of the Greater than Solomon, the crime of crimes, 
the destruction, the renewal by the Empress Helena, the Crusades,
and after a tribute (excusable at the time of excitement) to Sir 
<!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
183</span>Sidney Smith&rsquo;s defence of Acre, gradually rising 
to a magnificent description of the heavenly Jerusalem.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ten thousand harps attune the mystic 
throng,<br />
Ten thousand thousand saints the strain prolong.<br />
&lsquo;Worthy the Lamb, omnipotent to save!<br />
Who died, Who lives triumphant o&rsquo;er the grave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enthusiasm, the hush, the feeling, the acclamations have 
ever since been remembered at Oxford as unequalled.&nbsp; 
Heber&rsquo;s parents were both present, and his mother, 
repairing at once in her joy to his rooms, found him kneeling by 
his bedside, laying the burthen of honour and success upon his 
God.&nbsp; His father, recently recovered from illness, was so 
overcome and shaken by the pressure of the throng and the thunder
of applause as never entirely to recover the fatigue, and he died
eight months later, early in 1804.</p>
<p>The two youths who were in juxtaposition at the rostrum were 
not to meet again.&nbsp; Daniel Wilson was ordained to the curacy
of Chobham, under Mr. Cecil, an excellent master for impressing 
hard study on his curates.&nbsp; He writes: &ldquo;What should a 
young minister do?&nbsp; His office says, &lsquo;Go to your 
books, go to retirement, go to prayer.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; says the enthusiast, &lsquo;go to preach, go 
and be a witness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A witness of what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Wilson worked under Cecil, Heber, who was still too 
young for the family living of Hodnet, in Shropshire, after 
taking his bachelor&rsquo;s degree, obtaining a fellowship at All
Souls College, and gaining the prize for the prose essay, 
accompanied John Thornton on a tour through northern and eastern 
Europe, the only portions then accessible to the traveller; and, 
returning in 1806, was welcomed at home by his brother&rsquo;s 
tenants with a banquet, for which three sheep were slaughtered, 
and at which he appeared in the red coat of the volunteer 
regiment in which he had taken an eager share during former 
years.</p>
<p>It was his last appearance in a military character, for in 
1807 he was ordained, and entered on his duties as Rector of 
Hodnet.&nbsp; Two years later he married Amelia Shipley, the 
daughter of the Dean of St. Asaph.&nbsp; Floating thus easily 
into preferment, without a shoal or rock in his course, fairly 
wealthy, and belonging to a well-esteemed county family, 
connected through his brother with the very <i>&eacute;lite</i> 
of literary society, it seemed as <!-- page 184--><a 
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>though, in 
the laxity of the early part of the century, Reginald Heber could
hardly have helped falling into the indolence of learned ease, 
the peril of the well-beneficed clergy of his day, especially 
among those who had not accepted the peculiarities of the 
awakening school of the period.</p>
<p>But such was not the case.&nbsp; He was at once an earnest 
parish priest, working hard to win his people, not only to attend
at church, but to become regular communicants, and to give up 
their prevalent evil courses.&nbsp; We find him in one letter 
mentioning the writing of an article on Pindar in the 
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, planning for a village-school on the 
Lancastrian principle, and endeavouring to improve the 
psalmody.&nbsp; &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I have a 
better reason to plead for silence than the Cambridge man who, on
being asked in what pursuit he was then engaged, replied that he 
was diligently employed in suffering his hair to grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These &ldquo;endeavours to improve the psalmody&rdquo; were a 
forestalling of the victory over the version of Tate and 
Brady.&nbsp; The Olney Hymns, produced by Cowper, under the 
guidance of John Newton, had been introduced by Heber on his 
first arrival in the parish, but he felt the lack of something 
more thoroughly in accordance with the course of the Christian 
year, less personal and meditative, and more 
congregational.&nbsp; Therefore he produced by degrees a series 
of hymns, which he described as designed to be sung between the 
Nicene Creed and the Sermon, and to be connected in some degree 
with the Collects and Gospels for the day.&nbsp; Thus he was the 
real originator in England of the great system of appropriate 
hymnology, which has become almost universal, and many of his own
are among the most beautiful voices of praise our Church 
possesses.&nbsp; We would instance Nos. 135 and 263 in 
&ldquo;Hymns Ancient and Modern,&rdquo;&mdash;that for the 21st 
Sunday after Trinity, a magnificent Christian battle-song; and 
that for Innocents&rsquo; Day, an imitation of the old Latin hymn
&ldquo;<i>Salvete flores Martyrum</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were put
together, with others by Dean Milman and a few more, into a 
little volume, which Heber requested Dr. Howley, then Bishop of 
London, to lay before the Archbishop, that it might be 
recommended for use in churches, but the timidity of the time 
prevented this from being carried into effect.</p>
<p>A deep student of church history, his letters show him trying 
every practical question by the tests of ancient authority as 
well as instructive piety, and, on these principles, already 
deploring <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>the undue elevation of the pulpit 
and debasement of the Altar to which exclusive preference of 
preaching had led.&nbsp; Missions had, since the days of 
Carey&rsquo;s first opening of the subject become so predominant 
a thought with the Nonconformist bodies, and were often conducted
so irregularly, that there was certain dread and distrust of them
among the sober-minded and orthodox; but Heber was one of the 
first English churchmen who perceived that to enlarge her borders
and strengthen her stakes was the bounden duty of the living 
Church.&nbsp; He was a fervent admirer of Henry Martyn, whose 
biography was published soon after the news of his death reached 
England, and his feeling found vent in that hymn so familiar to 
us all&mdash;&ldquo;From Greenland&rsquo;s icy 
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was meantime rising in influence and station,&mdash;Canon 
of St. Asaph, Preacher at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, Select Preacher 
before the University.&nbsp; He was beloved by all ranks: by the 
poor for his boundless charity and sympathy; and by his equals, 
not only for these qualities, but for his sunny temper, bright 
wit, and playfulness, which showed in his conversation, his 
letters, and in many a droll, elegant, and scholarly <i>jeu 
d&rsquo;esprit</i>, thrown off by a mind that could do nothing 
without gracefulness.&nbsp; All this prosperity was alloyed only 
by such domestic sorrow as might be fitly termed gentle 
chastening.&nbsp; The death of his next brother, Thomas, who had 
acted as his curate, was a severe loss to him; and in the desire 
to make every affliction a stepping-stone in Christian progress, 
he began, from that date, a custom of composing a short 
collect-like prayer, veiled in Latin, on every marked occurrence 
in his life.&nbsp; The next occasion was, after several years of 
marriage, the birth of a little daughter, whom (in his own words)
&ldquo;he had the pleasure of seeing and caressing for six 
months,&rdquo; ere she faded away, and died just before the 
Christmas of 1817.&nbsp; He never could speak of her without 
tears, and (his wife tells us) ever after added to his private 
prayers a petition to be worthy to rejoin his &ldquo;sinless 
child.&rdquo;&nbsp; His grief and his faith further found voice 
in the hymn, each verse of which begins with &ldquo;Thou art gone
to the grave, but we will not deplore thee,&rdquo; and which 
finishes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou art gone to the grave, but we will not
deplore thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose God was thy ransom, thy Guardian and Guide.<br
/>
He gave thee, He took thee, and He will restore thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And death has no sting, for the Saviour has 
died.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Such had been the training of Reginald Heber, through 
the pleasant paths of successful scholarship and literature, and 
of well-beneficed country pastorship; a life perilous to 
spirituality and earnestness, but which he kept full of the salt 
of piety, charity and unwearied activity as parish priest, and as
one of the voices of the Church.&nbsp; Such had been his life up 
to 1822, when, on the tidings of the death of Dr. Middleton, 
Bishop of Calcutta, his friend Charles Williams Wynn, President 
of the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India, offered 
him the appointment.</p>
<p>To a man of his present position, talents, and prospects at 
home, the preferment was not advantageous: the income, with the 
heavy attendant expenses, would very little increase his means; 
the promotion threw him out of the chances of the like at home; 
and the labour and toil of the half-constituted and enormous 
diocese, the needful struggles with English irreligion and native
heathenism, and the perils of climate, offered a trying exchange 
for all that had made life delightful at Hodnet Rectory.&nbsp; A 
second little daughter too, whom he could not of course look to 
educating in India, rendered the decision more trying.&nbsp; But 
in his own peculiarly calm and simple way, he wrote: &ldquo;I 
really should not think myself justified in declining a situation
of so great usefulness, and for which, without vanity, I think 
myself not ill adapted, either from a love for the society and 
friendship of England, or from a hope, which may never be 
realized, of being some time or other in a situation of more 
importance at home.&rdquo;&nbsp; At first, however, the fear for 
the child&rsquo;s health induced him to decline, but only if 
anyone else equally suitable could be found; and finally he 
accepted it, with apparent coolness, veiling the deep spirit of 
zeal and enthusiasm that glowed within.&nbsp; It was not the 
ardent vehemence that enables some to follow their inward call, 
overcoming all obstacles, but it was calm obedience to a call 
from without.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I 
hope I am not enthusiastic in thinking that a clergyman is, like 
a soldier or a sailor, bound to go on any service, however remote
or undesirable, where the course of his duty leads him, and my 
destiny (though there are some circumstances attending it which 
make my heart ache) has many, very many, advantages in an 
extended sphere of professional activity, in the indulgence of 
literary curiosity, and, what to me has many charms, the 
opportunity of seeing nature in some of its wildest and most 
majestic features.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>In the spring of 1823, he took leave of Hodnet, amid 
the tears of his parishioners; and on the 18th of May preached 
his last sermon in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn chapel, on the 
Atonement.&nbsp; On coming out, one of the most leading men among
the Wesleyan Methodists could only express his feelings by 
exclaiming, &ldquo;Thank God for that man!&nbsp; Thank God for 
that man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is striking to find him in the full pressure of business, 
while preparing in London for his consecration and his voyage, 
making time for a letter to one of the Hodnet farmers, to warn 
him against habits of drunkenness, hoping that it would dwell 
with him &ldquo;as a voice from the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the 1st
of June, 1823, Reginald Heber was consecrated at Lambeth, and on 
the 10th sailed for India!&nbsp; He made several sketches along 
the southern coast, under one of which he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And we must have danger, and fever, and 
pain,<br />
Ere we look on the white rocks of Albion again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days later, when passing the western coast of France on 
a Sunday, the sound of the bells suggested the following 
meditative verses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bounding along the obedient surges,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheerly on her onward way,<br />
Her course the gallant vessel urges<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across thy stormy gulf, Biscay.<br />
In the sun the bright waves glisten;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rising slow with solemn swell,<br />
Hark, hark, what sound unwonted?&nbsp; Listen&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen&mdash;&rsquo;tis the Sabbath bell.</p>
<p>It tells of ties which duties sever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of hearts so fondly knit to thee,<br />
Kind hands, kind looks, which, wanderer, never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy hand shall grasp, thine eye shall see.<br />
It tells of home and all its pleasures,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of scenes where memory loves to dwell,<br />
And bids thee count thy heart&rsquo;s best treasures<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far, far away, that Sabbath bell.</p>
<p>Listen again!&nbsp; Thy wounded spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall soar from earth and seek above<br />
That kingdom which the blest inherit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mansions of eternal love.<br />
Earth and her lowly cares forsaking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bemoaned too keenly, loved too well,<br />
To faith and hope thy soul awaking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hear&rsquo;st with joy that Sabbath 
bell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>By the 28th of September, the vessel was in sight of 
the Temple of Jaghernauth, and on the 3rd of October was anchored
close to the island of Saugor.</p>
<p>All through his voyage and residence in India, the Bishop kept
a journal of the doings and scenes of each day, full of 
interesting sketches, both in pen and pencil.&nbsp; The beauty of
the villages on the Hooghly, &ldquo;the greenhouse-like smell and
temperature of the atmosphere,&rdquo; and the gentle countenances
and manners of the natives, struck him greatly, as he says, 
&ldquo;with a very solemn and earnest wish that I might in some 
degree, however small, be enabled to conduce to the spiritual 
advantage of creatures so goodly, so gentle, and now so misled 
and blinded.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Angili forent si essent 
Christiani</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 10th of October the Heber family entered their 
temporary abode in the Fort at Calcutta, and were received by two
Sepoy sentries and a long train of servants in cotton dresses and
turbans, one of them with a long silver stick, another with a 
mace.&nbsp; There, too, were assembled the neighbouring 
clergy&mdash;alas! far too few&mdash;and the next day the Bishop 
was installed in his cathedral.</p>
<p>Then began a life of very severe labour, for not only had the 
arrears of episcopal business after the interregnum to be made 
up, but the deficiency of clergy rendered the Sunday duties very 
heavy; and the Bishop took as full a share of them as any working
parish priest; and even though he authorized the Church 
Missionary Society&rsquo;s teachers to read prayers and to 
preach, the lack of sufficient ministrations was great.&nbsp; 
Bishop&rsquo;s College had, however, been completed, and what 
Middleton had founded was opened by Heber, with the happiest 
effect, which has lasted to the present time.</p>
<p>The difficulties as to the form of ordination of such as were 
not British subjects had also been overcome, and Christian David 
was to be sent up from Ceylon in company with Mr. Armour, who was
to receive Priest&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp; The latter excellent man 
died just before he was to set off, and this delayed David until 
the next spring, when he came to Calcutta, was lodged in 
Bishop&rsquo;s College, passed an excellent examination, and was 
ordained deacon on Holy Thursday, 1824, and priest on the ensuing
Trinity Sunday.&nbsp; He is memorable as the first man of the 
dark-skinned races admitted by the Church of England to her 
ministry.&nbsp; An excellent and well-expressed letter <!-- page 
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
189</span>from him, on the difficulties respecting the 
distinctions of caste, is given in Bishop Heber&rsquo;s 
Life.&nbsp; This, indeed, was one of the greatest troubles in 
dealing with converts.&nbsp; The Serampore missionaries had 
striven to destroy it, but Ziegenbalg, Schwartz, and their elder 
companions, regarded it as a distinction of society&mdash;not 
religious&mdash;and, though discouraging it, had not so opposed 
it as to insist on high and low castes mingling indiscriminately 
in church or at meals.&nbsp; The younger men who had since come 
out had been scandalized, and tried to make a change, which had 
led to much heartburning.</p>
<p>Next to his hymns, Bishop Heber is best known by the journal 
he kept of his visitation tour, not intended for publication but 
containing so much of vivid description of scenery and manners, 
that it forms a valuable picture of the condition of Hindostan as
it then was.</p>
<p>His first stage, in barges along the Ganges, brought him to 
Dacca, where he was delayed by the illness and death of his much 
esteemed and beloved chaplain.&nbsp; He then went on to 
Bhaugulpore, where he was much interested in a wild tribe called 
the Puharries, who inhabit the Rajmahal hills, remnants of the 
aborigines of India.&nbsp; They carried bows and arrows, lived by
the chase, and were viewed as great marauders; but they had a 
primitive faith, free from idolatry, hated falsehood, and, having
no observance of caste and a great respect for Europeans, seemed 
promising objects for a mission; but unfortunately the climate of
their mountains was so injurious to European life, that the 
clergyman, Mr. Thomas Christian, a scholar of Bishop&rsquo;s 
College, whom the Bishop appointed to this mission, was only able
to spend three months in the hills in the course of the year, 
while for the other nine he took the children under his 
instruction back with him to Bhaugulpore.</p>
<p>At Bankipore, the Bishop met Padre Giulio Cesare, still a 
remarkably handsome and intelligent-looking little man, and 
speaking warmly of Henry Martyn.&nbsp; Dinapore, that first 
station of Martyn&rsquo;s, had since his time fallen into a very 
unsatisfactory state, owing to the carelessness of his successor,
though it was newly come into better hands.</p>
<p>On the contrary, at Buxar, the Fort-adjutant, Captain Field, 
had so influenced all around, though without a chaplain, that, 
though the Bishop could not give the place a Sunday, his Saturday
evening service in the verandah was thronged, the English <!-- 
page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
190</span>soldiers coming with Prayer-books and making the 
responses, besides numerous Hindoos, many of them the Christian 
wives and children of the soldiers.&nbsp; There was a boys&rsquo;
school kept by a converted Mahometan, and one for girls by 
&ldquo;Mrs. Simpson,&rdquo; a native of Agra, converted by Mr. 
Corrie, and the widow of a sergeant.&nbsp; She, however, got no 
scholars but the half-caste daughters of the soldiers.&nbsp; A 
little boy of four years old, son to an English sergeant with a 
native wife, was baptized, and the Bishop was delighted with the 
reverent devotion of the spectators.&nbsp; Cureem Musseh, once a 
Sepoy havildar, had his sword and sash hung over the desk, where,
in a clean white cotton dress and turban, he presided over his 
scholars, whom he had taught to read Hindostanee, and to say the 
Creed, Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and Commandments, with a short 
exposition of each.&nbsp; The school served them likewise to hold
prayer-meetings in, and, on rare occasions, a clergyman visited 
them.</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s entrance into the sacred city of Benares he
describes to his wife thus: &ldquo;I will endeavour to give you 
an account of the concert, vocal and instrumental, which saluted 
us as we entered the town:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>First beggar</i>.&mdash;Agha Sahib!&nbsp; Judge 
Sahib, Burra Sahib, give me some pice; I am a fakir; I am a 
priest; I am dying of hunger!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bearers trotting under the tonjon</i>.&mdash;Ugh! 
ugh!&mdash;Ugh! ugh!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Musicians</i>.&mdash;Tingle, tangle; tingle, tangle;
bray, bray, bray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chuprassee</i>, <i>clearing the way with his 
sheathed sabre</i>.&mdash;Silence!&nbsp; Room for the Lord Judge,
the Lord Priest.&nbsp; Get out of the way!&nbsp; Quick!&nbsp; 
(<i>Then gently patting and stroking the broad back of a Brahmin 
bull</i>.)&nbsp; Oh, good man, move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bull</i>, <i>scarcely moving</i>.&mdash;Bu-u-uh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Second beggar</i>, <i>counting his beads</i>, 
<i>rolling his eyes</i>, <i>and moving his body backwards and 
forwards</i>.&mdash;Ram, ram; ram, ram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benares, said to be founded on the point of Siva&rsquo;s 
trident, as the most sacred city of all Hindostan, swarmed with 
beggars, fakirs, sacred animals, and idols of every description; 
but close beside it was a church for consecration and thirty 
candidates for confirmation, of whom fourteen were natives.&nbsp;
The next day the Bishop was taken to see a school founded by a 
rich Bengalee baboo, whom Mr. Corrie had almost persuaded to be 
<!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
191</span>a Christian, but who had settled down into a sort of 
general admiration for the beauty of the Gospel, and a wish to 
improve his countrymen.&nbsp; He had made over the house where 
the school was kept to the Church Missionary Society, and the 
staff consisted of an English schoolmaster, a Persian moonshee, 
and two Hindostanee writing masters, the whole presided over by 
an English catechist, a candidate for Holy Orders.&nbsp; There 
were several class rooms, and a large, lofty hall, supported by 
pillars, where the Bishop examined the 140, who read Persian and 
English, answered questions in Hindostanee and English, and 
showed great proficiency in writing, arithmetic, and 
geography.&nbsp; No objection was made to their reading the New 
Testament.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the Bishop looked into a little pagoda, 
richly carved, and containing an image of Siva, crowned with 
scarlet flowers, with lamps burning before him, and a painted 
bull in front, a little boy, one of the brightest scholars in the
school, came forward, and showing his Brahminical string, told, 
in tolerable English, the histories of the deities with which the
walls were painted.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; says the Bishop, 
&ldquo;opened my eyes more fully to a danger which had before 
struck me as possible, that some of the boys brought up in our 
schools might grow up accomplished hypocrites, playing the part 
of Christian with us, and with their own people of zealous 
followers of Brahma, or else that they would settle down in a 
sort of compromise between the two creeds, allowing that 
Christianity was the best for us, but that idolatry was necessary
and commendable in persons of their own nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
in fact seems to have been ever since the state of a large 
proportion of the educated Hindoos.&nbsp; May it be only a 
transition state!</p>
<p>The street preaching employed by the Serampore community had 
not been resorted to by the Church Missionary Society, and Bishop
Heber decided that in the fanatic population, amid the crowds of 
bulls, beggars, and sacred apes, it was far wiser not to attempt 
it; but the missionaries were often sent for to private houses to
converse with natives of rank, on their doctrine.&nbsp; One 
notable Hindoo, Amrut Row, who had at one time been Peishwa of 
the Mahrattas, who had retired to Benares, used on the feast of 
his patron god to give a portion of rice and a rupee to every 
Brahmin and blind or lame person who applied between sunrise and 
sunset.&nbsp; He had a large garden with four gates, three of 
which were set open for the three classes of <!-- page 192--><a 
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>applicants;
the fourth served himself and his servants.&nbsp; As each person 
received his dole, he was shown into the garden, and detained 
there to prevent his applying twice, but there he enjoyed plenty 
of shade, water, company, and idols!&nbsp; This day&rsquo;s 
distribution often amounted to above 50,000 rupees, and his 
charities altogether were three times as great in the course of 
every year.&nbsp; He was a good kind man, religious to the best 
of his knowledge; and just before the Bishop&rsquo;s visit, he 
had sent a message to Mr. Morris, the clergyman at Sealcote, to 
call on him in the middle of the next week as he wished to 
inquire further into Christianity.&nbsp; Alas! before the 
appointed day Amrut Row was dead, and his ashes were still 
smoking when the Bishop quitted Benares.</p>
<p>What had become of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s church does not 
appear, for at Cawnpore he found none, but service was 
alternately performed in a bungalow and in the 
riding-school.&nbsp; He went as far north as Oude, and found at 
Chinear a much larger native congregation than he expected, 
though the women still retained so much of Eastern customs that 
they would not even raise their veils when receiving the Holy 
Communion.&nbsp; Almost all were the converts of the excellent 
Mr. Corrie, Henry Martyn&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>Arriving at Surat, after a journey of ten months, he there 
embarked for Bombay, where his wife and eldest child came from 
Calcutta, by sea, to meet him, and thence, after a stay in Ceylon
for some weeks, returned to Calcutta, where, in December, he 
ordained Abdul Messeh, the man who had been won by Henry 
Martyn&rsquo;s garden preachings.&nbsp; It was a very remarkable 
ordination, for Father Abraham, the Armenian Suffragan from the 
Patriarch of Jerusalem, was present, in the black robes of his 
convent, and laid his hand on the heads of the candidates, and 
the service was in Hindostanee, whenever Abdul Messeh was 
individually concerned.&nbsp; Abdul Messeh was a most valuable 
worker among his countrymen, but he only survived about eighteen 
months.</p>
<p>In his last letter to the Society for the Propagation of the 
Gospel, the Bishop records the reception into Bishop&rsquo;s 
College of Mesrop David, the kinsman of the Armenian Bishop and 
already a deacon; also of two native youths from Ceylon, one 
Tamul and one Cingalese.&nbsp; This college, though a work which 
had none of the romance of adventure about it, afforded the <!-- 
page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
193</span>surest and most important means of thoroughly 
implanting the Gospel, and forming a native priesthood fit for 
the varying needs of the various people.&nbsp; Nor could such a 
task be committed to any but superior men.&nbsp; Only such as 
have abilities that would win them distinction in England, are 
fit to cope with the difficulties of dealing with intellects 
quite as argumentative as, and even more subtle than, those of 
the ordinary level of Englishmen.</p>
<p>Soon after writing this letter, Bishop Heber set forth on what
was to prove his last visitation.&nbsp; On the voyage to Madras, 
he spent much time upon some invalid soldiers who were being sent
home, and confirmed one of them on board.&nbsp; Also he devoted 
himself to comforting a poor lady whose baby died on the voyage, 
not only when with her in her cabin, but Archdeacon Robinson, his
chaplain, could hear him weeping and praying for her when alone 
in his own.</p>
<p>At Madras, he was lodged in the house of Sir Thomas Munro, the
governor, who had done much by the help of his excellent wife to 
promote all that was good.&nbsp; At Vepery, close at hand, the 
Bishop found, nearly finished, the first church built in the 
Gothic style in India.&nbsp; He was greatly delighted with it, 
and especially that the desk and pulpit had not been allowed to 
obstruct the view of the altar, which had more dignity than was 
usual in the churches of 1826.&nbsp; A monstrous pulpit in 
another little church at Poonamalee, a dep&ocirc;t for recruits, 
and an asylum for pensioners and soldiers&rsquo; children, he 
caused to be removed.&nbsp; He had a confirmation at this place, 
or rather two, for some unexpected candidates presented 
themselves, and he desired Archdeacon Robinson to examine them, 
so that they might be confirmed later in the day.&nbsp; Among 
them was an old pensioner, and a sickly-looking young woman with 
a little boy, whom the Archdeacon thought too young, and 
recommended her to keep back for another opportunity.&nbsp; She 
wept much, and the Bishop said, &ldquo;Bring them both to me; who
knows whether they may live to wish for it again?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The native Christians, poor people employed on the beach, 
remnants of the old Portuguese Missions, had built a church at 
their own expense, and, being unable to obtain regular 
ministrations from their own clergy, begged the Bishop to 
consecrate their building, and give them a clergyman, and this he
hoped to do on his return.</p>
<p>Meantime, he went in his robes to present Lady Munro with <!--
page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
194</span>a vote of thanks from the Society for Promoting 
Christian Knowledge, for the good works in the schools of her 
husband&rsquo;s government.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have seldom witnessed 
a more interesting or affecting picture,&rdquo; writes Archdeacon
Robinson: &ldquo;the beauty and gracefulness of Lady Munro, the 
grave and commanding figure of the Governor, the youthful 
appearance and simple dignity of the dear Bishop, the beloved of 
all beholders, presented a scene such as few can ever hope to 
witness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, 
with the tears rolling down his cheeks, &ldquo;it will be vain 
for me after this to preach humility to Lady Munro; she will be 
proud of this day to the latest hour she lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, Sir Thomas!&rdquo; was all the Bishop 
could utter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And God bless <i>you</i>, my lord!&rdquo; was the 
fervent answer.</p>
<p>Before eighteen months had passed the two good men who 
exchanged this blessing, had met in Paradise!</p>
<p>The Bishop went on from Madras, travelling by d&acirc;k, and 
encamping during the heat of the day.&nbsp; He soon came into the
field of labour of the Danish Missions, and was disappointed to 
find how poor and forlorn the Christian converts about Cuddalore 
were, and the great want of employment for them.&nbsp; Things 
were better in the Tanjore territory, where the Bishop was much 
interested by a visit from the native pastor of one of the 
villages, a fine, venerable old man.&nbsp; When about to take 
leave, he lingered, and the Bishop was told that the Tamul 
Christians never quitted a minister without receiving his 
blessing.&nbsp; He was greatly touched.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will bless
them all, the good people,&rdquo; he said, after blessing the 
pastor.</p>
<p>Arriving at Tanjore, the Bishop thus describes 
Serfojee:&mdash;&ldquo;I have been passing the last four days in 
the society of a Hindoo Prince, the Rajah of Tanjore, who quotes 
Fourcroy, Lavoilier, Linn&aelig;us, and Buffon fluently; has 
formed a more accurate judgment of the poetical merits of 
Shakespeare than that so felicitously expressed by Lord Byron; 
and has actually emitted English poetry, very superior indeed to 
Rousseau&rsquo;s epitaph on Shenstone; at the same time that he 
is much respected by the English officers in his neighbourhood, 
as a real good judge of a horse, and a cool, bold, and deadly 
shot at a tiger.&nbsp; The truth is, that he is an extraordinary 
man, who, having in early youth received such an education as old
Schwartz, the celebrated <!-- page 195--><a 
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>missionary,
could give him, has ever since continued, in the midst of many 
disadvantages, to preserve his taste for, and extend his 
knowledge of, European literature: while he has never neglected 
the active exercises and frank, soldierly bearing which become 
the descendant of the old Mahratta conquerors; and by which only,
in the present state of things, he has it in his power to gratify
the prejudices of his people, and prolong his popularity among 
them.&nbsp; Had he lived in the days of Hyder, he would have been
a formidable ally or enemy; for he is, by the testimony of all in
his neighbourhood, frugal, bold, popular, and insinuating.&nbsp; 
At present, with less power than an English nobleman, he holds 
his head high, and appears contented; and the print of 
Buonaparte, which hangs in his library, is so neutralized by that
of Lord Hastings in full costume, that it can do no harm to 
anybody. . . . To finish the portrait of Maha Raja Sarbojee, I 
should tell you that he is a strong-built and very handsome 
middle-aged man, with eyes and nose like a fine hawk, and very 
bushy grey mustachios, generally splendidly dressed, but with no 
effeminacy of ornament, and looking and talking more like a 
favourable specimen of a French general officer than any other 
object of comparison which occurs to me.&nbsp; His son, Raja 
Seroojee (so named after their great ancestor), is a pale, 
sickly-looking lad of seventeen, who also speaks English, but 
imperfectly, and on whose account his father lamented, with much 
apparent concern, the impossibility which he found of obtaining 
any tolerable instruction in Tanjore.&nbsp; I was moved at this, 
and offered to take him on my tour, and afterwards to Calcutta, 
where he might have apartments in my house, and be introduced 
into good English society; at the same time that I would 
superintend his studies, and procure for him the best masters 
which India affords.&nbsp; The father and son, in different 
ways,&mdash;the one catching at the idea with great eagerness, 
the other as if he were afraid to say all he wished,&mdash;seemed
both well pleased with the proposal.&nbsp; Both, however, on 
consulting together, expressed a doubt of the mother&rsquo;s 
concurrence; and, accordingly, next day I had a very civil 
message, through the Resident, that the Rannee had already lost 
two sons; that this survivor was a sickly boy; that she was sure 
he would not come back alive, and it would kill her to part with 
him; but that all the family joined in gratitude, &amp;c.&nbsp; 
So poor Seroojee must chew betel and sit in the zenana, and 
pursue the other <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>amusements of the common race of 
Hindoo princes, till he is gathered to those heroic forms who, 
girded with long swords with hawks on their wrists, and garments 
like those of the king of spades (whose portrait-painter, as I 
guess, has been retained by this family), adorn the principal 
room in the palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the Bishop&rsquo;s great indignation, he found that whereas
while the Rajah had retained his dominions, Christians had been 
eligible to all the different offices of State, there was now an 
order from the Company&rsquo;s Government against their admission
to any employment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we
are, in matters of religion, the most lukewarm and cowardly 
people on the face of the earth.&nbsp; I mean to make this and 
some other things I have seen a matter of formal representation 
to all the three Governments of India, and to the Board of 
Control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is highly probable that this systematic dread of 
encouraging God&rsquo;s service on the part of the Company 
assisted in keeping Serfojee a heathen, in spite of the many 
prayers offered up for him.&nbsp; Almost the last in 
Heber&rsquo;s book of private devotions was for the Rajah; and he
drew up one, to be translated into Tamul, for use in all the 
churches in his territory; this last not directly for his 
conversion, but for his temporal and spiritual welfare.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to know that the last Easter of Heber&rsquo;s 
life was made joyful by ministering to Schwartz&rsquo;s spiritual
children.&nbsp; He preached in that church which Schwartz had 
raised, and where his monument stood.&nbsp; His text was, 
&ldquo;I am He that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive 
for evermore.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many English-speaking natives went 
there, and others besides; and at the Holy Eucharist that 
followed there were thirty English and fifty-seven native 
communicants.&nbsp; The delight and admiration of the Bishop were
speedily apparent.&nbsp; In the evening he attended a Tamul 
service, where the prayers were said by a Hindoo, the sermon 
preached by a Dane, and the blessing delivered by the Bishop in 
Tamul, to the surprise and pleasure of the congregation, which 
numbered no less than 1,300, all reverent, all making the 
responses, joining in the Easter hymn, and in the 100th 
Psalm.&nbsp; Never had the Bishop been happier!&nbsp; As he was 
taking off his robes, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Gladly would I 
exchange years of common life for <i>one</i> such day as 
this!&rdquo;&nbsp; Even at night he could not help coming back to
Archdeacon Robinson&rsquo;s room to rejoice, discuss, and finally
pray over this blessed fruit of the toils of a holy man, who had 
been at rest <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>thirty-eight years, yet whose work 
still increased.&nbsp; The next day he confirmed a large number; 
and Kohloff, a contemporary missionary of Schwartz, preached in 
Tamul.</p>
<p>After this happy Easter, the Bishop continued his route to 
Trichinopoly, where he preached and confirmed on the Sunday, but 
complained of a slight headache, and allowed himself to be 
persuaded not to go to the native service in the evening, though 
he spent a good deal of time conversing with Mr. Robinson, who 
was unwell enough to be lying in bed.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 3rd of April, he went at daybreak to hold a 
Tamul confirmation at the poor little neglected native church; 
then looked at the schools, but found that the want of 
ventilation rendered them too oppressive for him to remain; and 
afterwards received and graciously answered an address from the 
poor Christians, praying him to send them a pastor, for they had 
been without one for two years.&nbsp; He came back, still in his 
robes, to Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s bedroom, and, with great 
eagerness, talked over what he had seen and heard; speaking of 
the destitution of this poor church, and of the needfulness that 
a Bishop should receive regular reports of every station; also 
mentioning a Danish missionary whom he intended to appoint.&nbsp;
He then went to his own room, and, according to Indian habit 
after exertion, went out in order to bathe.&nbsp; The bath was in
a separate building.&nbsp; It was fifteen feet long, eight broad,
and with stone steps descending into it to a depth of seven feet,
and it was perfectly full of water.&nbsp; The servant sitting 
outside wondered at the length of time and unbroken silence, and 
at last looked in; but Reginald Heber had, by that time, long 
been lifeless in the cold bath!</p>
<p>He was only in his forty-fourth year; but medical opinion 
declared that there had been, unsuspected, the seeds of fatal 
disease, accelerated by climate, exertion, and excitement, and 
such as would probably have caused long helplessness and 
inaction, unless thus suddenly developed.</p>
<p>He was buried the next day at Trichinopoly church, where the 
mural tablet, with most touching and appropriate simplicity, 
bears no inscription in laudation, but merely the holy words, 
&ldquo;Be ye also ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus ended a life of inward and outward brightness, which 
comes like a stream of sunshine among the shadows through which 
most of the labourers had to struggle, either for want of <!-- 
page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
198</span>means of education, or from poverty or melancholy, and 
yet as true and as exhilarating a course as was ever one of 
theirs.&nbsp; May we not read his description in the 
verse:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And there are souls that seem to dwell<br 
/>
Above this earth&mdash;so rich a spell<br />
Floats round their steps where&rsquo;er they move,<br />
Of hopes fulfilled, and mutual love:<br />
Such, if on high their hopes are set,<br />
Nor in the stream the source forget;<br />
If, prompt to quit the bliss they know,<br />
Following the Lamb where&rsquo;er He go,<br />
By purest pleasures unbeguiled<br />
To idolize or wife or child,<br />
Such wedded souls our God shall own<br />
For faultless virgins round His throne.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Heber published soon after her return her husband&rsquo;s
journals, and these, bearing the impress of his graceful, 
scholarly hand, attracted many readers who care merely for 
information and amusement; and thus, by their mere mundane 
qualities, his writings did much to spread knowledge of, and 
therefore interest in, the field of labour in which he 
died.&nbsp; Large subscriptions came into the societies, and in a
few years a church and three schools for the natives, with the 
pastor he had indicated, served as the best monument of that Low 
Sunday at Trichinopoly.</p>
<p>His successor was John Thomas James: the most memorable event 
in whose life was a halt at the Cape of Good Hope.&nbsp; This was
the first time that colony had ever been visited by a Bishop, and
there was no church, though a piece of land had been newly 
granted for one, which he consecrated before proceeding on his 
voyage.&nbsp; He arrived in 1828, but the climate of Calcutta 
struck him for death almost immediately.&nbsp; He was only able 
to perform one ordination, one confirmation, and one charge to 
the Calcutta clergy, then was forced to embark, and died at sea 
within a few months of his arrival.</p>
<p>During this time Daniel Wilson had been working under Mr. 
Cecil at Chobham, where he remained for three years, when a 
tutorship at St. Edmund&rsquo;s Hall was offered to him, which 
enabled him to marry his cousin Ann, combining the small living 
of Warton with his tutorship.&nbsp; On the death of the Rev. 
Richard Cecil he took, by his especial wish, his proprietary 
chapel in Bloomsbury, and there continued till 1824 as one of 
<!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
199</span>the most marked London clergy, keeping up the 
earnestness that Newton and Cecil had been noted for, with quite 
as much energy; and though without the same originality, there 
was a <i>telling</i> force about his sermons which made a young 
man exclaim the first time he heard him, &ldquo;I will never hear
Daniel Wilson again,&rdquo; but something led him happily to 
infringe the resolution, and then it became, &ldquo;I will 
always, if possible, hear Daniel Wilson.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sentences 
of his were very memorable; for instance, 
&ldquo;Nineteen-twentieths of sanctification consist in holy 
tempers,&rdquo; and, besides exhibiting a pithy force of 
language, his sermons were prepared with infinite care and 
labour.&nbsp; When at St. John&rsquo;s, where he had no parochial
charge, he selected his text on Monday and carried it about with 
him, so to speak, all the week, chewing the cud of it as it were,
looking it up in every authority, ancient or modern, within his 
reach, and conversing on the subject with any one whom he thought
likely to give him a hint.&nbsp; The sermons were written in a 
large legible shorthand, only on one side of the paper, and on 
the opposite page were copied out extracts of translations from 
illustrative authors, often as many as eight to a single sermon, 
so that he had in fact a huge secretion of stores, which he could
adapt according to the needs of his congregation, and he made 
notes of what he found fall flat and incomprehensible, or what he
felt was stirring the souls of his audience; and this time was 
most profitably spent, not only for his immediate congregation, 
but in laying up a provision for the busier days of after-life, 
when the same amount of study was out of his power.&nbsp; And the
benefit of such painstaking may be estimated by the words of a 
gentleman when introduced to a relative of his in after-years, 
&ldquo;I am only one of very many who do not know and never spoke
to Mr. Wilson, but to whom he has been a father in <span 
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; He never will know, and he 
never ought to know, the good that he has been the means of 
doing, for no man could bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proprietary chapels have now nearly become extinct.&nbsp; They
were an effect of the neglect of the heathenish eighteenth 
century, and one of the means of providing church room by private
speculation; and thus they almost necessarily were liable to the 
abuses of popularity-hunting and of lack of care for individuals,
especially the poor: but a man in thorough earnestness is sure to
draw good even out of a defective system; and Daniel Wilson, 
sitting in his study which was connected with the chapel, <!-- 
page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
200</span>became the counsellor of hundreds who sought spiritual 
advice and assistance, chiefly of the upper and well-to-do 
classes, but he took care to avoid wasting time over these 
conferences, and when it came to mere talk would put 
people&rsquo;s hats and umbrellas into their hands.&nbsp; There 
were also large Sunday-schools connected with his chapel, and 
taught by the members of his congregation, and these led to the 
first organization of a district visitors&rsquo; society, one of 
the earliest attempts of the slowly reviving English Church to 
show her laity how to minister to the poor under pastoral 
direction.</p>
<p>His father-in-law, Mr. William Wilson, had purchased the 
advowson of the living of Islington, and, when it became vacant 
in 1824, presented it to him, when he carried thither all his 
vigour and thoroughness.&nbsp; Church building was his first 
necessity, and he absolutely prevailed on his parish to rate 
themselves for the purpose, so that three churches were begun 
almost at once, and by the time his Life was written in 1860 the 
great suburb had multiplied its single church in thirty-six years
into fifteen.&nbsp; At Islington the chief sorrows of his life 
befel him.&nbsp; He had had six children, of whom one died an 
infant and two more in early childhood.&nbsp; The second son, 
John, after a boyhood of great promise, fell into temptation at 
the University and led a wild and degrading course; ending by his
retirement to the Continent, where he died in 1833, after a very 
painful illness, in which he had evinced great agony of mind, 
which softened at length into repentance and hope.&nbsp; The 
eldest son, Daniel, who attended him on his death-bed, had taken 
holy orders and succeeded to his father&rsquo;s former living of 
Warton; and one daughter, Eliza, born in 1814, survived to cheer 
his home when his wife, after some years of invalidism, died in 
1827.&nbsp; Zealous, resolute, and hardworking, he never allowed 
sorrow to interfere with his work, and was soon in the midst of 
his confirmation classes, and of a scheme for educating young 
tradespeople on a more thorough and religious system.</p>
<p>In the meantime he had always loved and urged the missionary 
cause, and had consulted with Bishop Turner before he went 
out.&nbsp; When the news of his decease was received (the fourth 
Bishop to die at his post within nine years), the appointment 
began to be looked on as a sentence of death, and it was declined
in succession by several eminent clergymen.&nbsp; Daniel Wilson 
had anxiously watched for the answer in each case, and <!-- page 
201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
201</span>was suggesting several persons to Mr. Charles Grant, 
when the thought struck him, &ldquo;Here I am, send 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; A widower of fifty-four years old, of much 
strength, and with no young children, seemed to him the fit 
person to volunteer to fill the breach; and he wrote stating, 
that if no one else could be found for the post, he was willing 
to offer himself.&nbsp; The appointment was accordingly given to 
him, after an interval of nine months since the see had become 
vacant, and an infinity of toil and arrangements crowded on 
him.&nbsp; Islington was resigned to his son Daniel, and he was 
consecrated by Archbishop Howley on the 29th of April, 1832, 
&ldquo;the day of my espousals to <span 
class="smcap">Christ</span> my Saviour,&rdquo; as he wrote in his
journal; and on the ensuing 18th of June he sailed with his 
daughter for Calcutta.&nbsp; The ship touched at the Cape, which 
under the government of Sir Lowry Cole was by no means in the 
same hopeless state of neglect as when Martyn had visited 
it.&nbsp; Bishop Wilson there held an ordination and a 
confirmation, the first for himself as well as for South Africa, 
whose Episcopate was not founded till twenty-three years 
later.</p>
<p>He landed at Calcutta on the 5th of November, 1832, and took 
possession of the large unfurnished house that had at last been 
wrung out of Government.&nbsp; He found only just enough chairs 
and tables, placed there by the Archdeacon, to suffice for 
immediate use; and was answered, when he asked why his orders 
that the place should be completely fitted up had not been 
attended to, &ldquo;I thought this would be enough to last for 
six months,&rdquo;&mdash;this being the term for which a Bishop 
of Calcutta was thought likely to need earthly furniture.&nbsp; 
But Bishop Wilson was resolved to take reasonable precaution, and
not to be daunted, or to act as if he were afraid.&nbsp; He 
furnished the place, and rented a pleasant country-house, called 
the Hive, at Tittaghur, where he spent a few days of every week; 
and, having been told that much danger was incurred by the 
exertion of visitation tours before the constitution had become 
accustomed to the climate, he resolved to wait for two years 
before making any long journey; and, in the meantime, he was able
to collect a great amount of information, as well as attending to
the regulation of matters at head-quarters.&nbsp; He kept up more
formality and state than Bishop Heber had done; and, of course, 
as the one had been censured for his simplicity, so the other was
found fault with for pomp and stiffness.&nbsp; But these <!-- 
page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
202</span>were minor points, chiefly belonging to the character 
of the two men, whose whole natures were in curious accordance 
with their prize performances at Oxford,&mdash;the one with all 
the warmth, fire, and animation of the poet of Palestine, 
sensitive to every impression, and making all serve to light his 
altar-flame; the other all common-sense, sincere, deep, and 
laborious, but with a narrower range of sympathies, and afraid of
all that might distract attention from the one great 
subject.&nbsp; General literature had no charms for Wilson.&nbsp;
He is believed never to have read one of Scott&rsquo;s poems or 
novels; and the playful mirth that enlivened all Heber&rsquo;s 
paths was not with him, though he had the equable cheerfulness of
a faithful servant doing his Lord&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; His 
daughter, soon after his arrival, married her cousin, Josiah 
Bateman, his chaplain (and biographer), and thus continued to be 
the mistress of her father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>On the Whitsunday of 1833 the Bishop baptized one of those 
Hindoo gentlemen who are among the most satisfactory of Christian
converts; they are free from the suspicion of interested motives 
which has always attached to the pariahs and low-caste people who
hung about Serampore and its dependent stations, and, justly or 
unjustly, were accused of turning Christians when they had 
exhausted other resources of idleness and knavery.&nbsp; A 
curious instance of a thorough conversion happened the same 
year.&nbsp; A lad, educated like most other well-to-do Hindoos in
the schools of the Church Missionary at Mirzampore, when about 
fifteen, became persuaded of the saving grace of Christianity, 
and determined to be baptized and openly forsake his idols.&nbsp;
His parents persecuted him, and he fled to a friend, a Hindoo 
convert; but he was seized by his relations, and the case was 
referred to the Supreme Court, who decided that the 
father&rsquo;s power over the son must not be interfered with; 
and the poor boy was dragged away, clinging to the 
barrister&rsquo;s table, amid the shouts of the heathen and the 
tears of the Christians.&nbsp; The boy remained staunch, and 
three years later came again and received baptism; but his 
sufferings had injured his health, both of mind and body, and his
promise of superior intelligence was blighted.</p>
<p>In 1834, the Bishop set off on his first long journey, which 
included Penang and Moulmein, where the Judsons had taken refuge 
after the Burmese war, and where he found, in the midst of 
half-cleared jungle and Buddhist temples full of <!-- page 
203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
203</span>enormous idols, a school kept by an American master, so
full of notions of equality, that, at the examination, he 
expected the Bishop to go to each class, not the class to the 
Bishop.</p>
<p>The Commissioner had built a church, the walls of teak slabs, 
and the pillars each a single teak-tree, and it was ready for 
consecration.&nbsp; After this and a confirmation, the Bishop 
went on his way to Ceylon, and then to the Madras Presidency, 
where he had already had a long correspondence with the pastors 
of the Christian congregations on the question of caste.&nbsp; 
Things had not prospered of late; and, to the dismay of the 
Bishop, he found that, in the course of the last year, 168 
Christians had fallen back to heathenism, where, not having 
broken their caste, they could still be received and find a 
place.&nbsp; The truth was that, though caste might appear only a
distinction of mere social rank, it was derived from a pagan 
superstition, and was a stronghold of heathenism.&nbsp; Schwartz 
was all his life trying to make it wear and die out, lest the 
violent renunciation should be too much for his converts&rsquo; 
faith.&nbsp; But his successors had allowed the feeling to 
retrograde; and Bishop Wilson found separate services, sides of 
the church allotted to the high and low castes, and the most 
unchristian distinctions made between them.&nbsp; He decided that
toleration of the prejudice was only doing harm, and issued 
orders that henceforth catechumens preparing for baptism, 
confirmation, or communion, should be called on to renounce caste
as a condition of admittance; and that, though the adult 
communicants should be gently dealt with, there should be no 
recognition of the distinction in the places in church, in the 
order of administering the Holy Communion, in marriages or 
processions, and that differences of food or dress, or marks on 
the forehead, should be discontinued.&nbsp; The clergy were in 
consternation, and made an appeal before they published the 
Bishop&rsquo;s letter to their flocks; but they found his mind 
made up, and yielded.&nbsp; The lesser stations complied without 
much difficulty; but at Trichinopoly, Vepery, and Tanjore, there 
were many Soodras, the soldier-caste, professing to have come 
from Brahma&rsquo;s shoulders, and second only to the 
Brahmins.&nbsp; They were desperately offended.&nbsp; At 
Trichinopoly, only seven Soodra families continued to attend the 
services, although the seceders behaved quietly, and offered no 
insults either to the clergy or the pariahs.&nbsp; At Vepery, on 
the <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>reading of the Bishop&rsquo;s 
letter, the whole Soodra population walked out <i>en masse</i>, 
except one catechist, who joined them afterwards.&nbsp; They then
drew up a paper, declaring that they would not yield, and would 
neither come to church nor send their children to school, unless 
they continued to be distinguished; and they set up a service of 
their own in a chapel lent them by a missionary belonging to the 
London Society.&nbsp; He was, however, reprimanded for this by 
the committee which employed him at Madras, and the chapel was 
withdrawn; upon which the Soodras remained without any public 
worship whatever for five months, when the catechists and 
schoolmasters came forward and acknowledged their pride and 
contumacy, the children dropped into the schools, and the 
grown-up people, one by one, returned to church, but in their own
way.</p>
<p>At Tanjore, the contest was a much harder one.&nbsp; Serfojee 
had died in 1834, and the son whom Bishop Heber had vainly tried 
to obtain for education was one of the ordinary specimens of 
indolent, useless rajahs, enjoying ease and display under British
protection; but the Mission had gone on thriving as to numbers, 
though scarcely as to earnestness or energy; and the Christians 
numbered 7,000, with 107 catechists and four native clergy, under
the management of Mr. Kohloff, almost the last of 
Schwartz&rsquo;s fellow-workers.&nbsp; The Bishop&rsquo;s letter 
was read aloud by him, after the sermon, on the 10th of November,
1833.&nbsp; There was an immediate clamour of all the Soodras, 
who would not be hushed by being reminded that they were in 
church, and, while Mr. Kohloff was being assisted from the 
pulpit, gathered round his wife and insulted her.</p>
<p>Letters passed between the Soodras and the missionaries.&nbsp;
There was no denial that the Bishop&rsquo;s command was right in 
itself; but an immense variety of excuses were offered for not 
complying with it, and only one of the four priests 
consented,&mdash;Nyanapracasem, an old man of eighty, who may be 
remembered as one of Schwartz&rsquo;s earliest converts, and of 
the four priests ordained by the Lutherans,&mdash;with three 
catechists, and ten of the general body; all the others remained 
in a state of secession.&nbsp; When the first death took place 
among them, Nyanapracasem, the one conforming priest, was 
appointed to read the funeral service; but he fell sick, and the 
only substitute available on the spot was a low-caste catechist, 
a very respectable man, but <!-- page 205--><a 
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>whom the 
Soodras silenced with threats, employing one of their own people 
in his stead.&nbsp; Next time, they borrowed the Roman Catholic 
burial-ground, and services were carried on, on Sunday, by one of
the dissentient priests, but marriages were celebrated in the 
heathen fashion, and there was evidently a strong disposition to 
form a schism, which the reckless, easy, self-willed conduct of 
the Soodras showed would be Christianity only in name.&nbsp; 
There had even been an appeal to the Governor-General, and the 
Bishop felt the whole tone of Christianity in India to be at 
stake.</p>
<p>It was in the height of this crisis that his journey to Madras
was made in the track of Bishop Heber.&nbsp; Twice he preached at
Vepery, and the Soodras attended; but he asked no questions, and 
let them place themselves as they chose, and take precedence, 
intending to fight out the question at Tanjore.</p>
<p>There, at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning of January 10, 
1835, on the bank of the Cavery River, he was received by all the
faithful Christians and school-children, headed by Kohloff and 
Nyanapracasem, These were the two remaining fellow-workers of 
Schwartz.&nbsp; Kohloff, now becoming aged, had his hair long and
loose round his florid German face; he was still a true German, 
full of simple kindness, and his English had a good deal of 
accent.&nbsp; His Hindoo companion was a beautiful old man, with 
long snowy hair flowing over his long white robes, who took the 
Bishop&rsquo;s hand between both of his, and blessed God for his 
coming, hoping that as Elijah brought back the stiff-necked 
Israelites, so the Bishop might turn the hearts of the 
Soodras.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon, a great party of these assembled to lay 
their complaints before the Bishop, bringing their two 
dissentient priests.&nbsp; One was of doubtful character, and was
unnoticed; but to the other, John Pillay, the Bishop addressed 
himself, telling him to assure the other Christians that his 
heart was full of love, and that he would hear their grievances, 
and answer them another time, when less weary with his 
journey.</p>
<p>Several spoke, and the Bishop listened to their individual 
cases.&nbsp; They were anxious to come and hear his sermon, but 
would only do so if allowed to sit apart; and to this, as one 
great object was to obtain their attention, the Bishop consented,
with a reservation that it was only for that once.&nbsp; The 
church was thronged, and after a Tamul service, the <!-- page 
206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
206</span>Bishop preached, pausing after every sentence that a 
catechist might render his words into Tamul.&nbsp; The text was, 
&ldquo;Walk in love, as Christ also loved us,&rdquo; and the 
latter part of his discourse was on the lesson from the Good 
Samaritan, as to &ldquo;who is my neighbour.&rdquo;&nbsp; There 
was at the end a long pause of breathless silence, and then he 
called on everyone present to offer up the following prayer: 
&ldquo;Lord, give me a broken heart to receive the love of 
Christ, and obey His commands.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole 
congregation repeated the words aloud in Tamul, and then he gave 
the blessing and dismissed them.</p>
<p>After this there were a great number of private 
conferences.&nbsp; People came and owned that they had been very 
unhappy; religion had died in their hearts, and they had had no 
peace; but their wives were the great objectors&mdash;they feared
whether they should marry their daughters, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; 
The two priests especially saw the badness of their 
standing-ground, but they should lose respect, they said.&nbsp; 
No Pariah seems to have been in holy orders, but if a Pariah 
catechist visited a sick person, he was not allowed to come under
the roof, and the patient was carried out into the 
verandah.&nbsp; And then came a rather stormy conference with 
about 150 Soodras, which occupied two days, since every sentence 
had to pass through an interpreter.&nbsp; The objections were 
various, but as a body the resistance continued, and it was only 
individuals that came over; some of these, however, did, and it 
was so clear from all that had passed that to permit the 
distinctions was but a truckling to heathenism, that the Bishop 
was more than ever resolved on firmness.&nbsp; Two of the priests
had conformed, and the Christianity of those who would not do so 
was plainly not worth having.</p>
<p>There was some polite intercourse with Serfojee&rsquo;s son, 
whose taste was visible in the alteration of a fine statue of his
father by Flaxman, from which the white marble turban had been 
removed to substitute a coloured one, with black feathers and 
tassels.&nbsp; In him the family has become extinct, since he 
only left a daughter, and the adoption of a son, after the old 
Hindoo fashion, has not been permitted by Government.</p>
<p>Thence, Bishop Wilson proceeded towards Trichinopoly.&nbsp; He
encamped, by the way, at a place called Muttooputty, a large 
station on the Coleroon river, where the way had been so prepared
for him that there was a grand throng of native Christians, 
untroubled about caste, and he was obliged literally to lengthen 
<!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
207</span>the cords and strengthen the stakes of the large tent 
used as a chapel.&nbsp; It was one of the memorable days of joy 
that come now and then to support the laborious spirit of the 
faithful servant.&nbsp; &ldquo;One such day as we have just 
passed is worth years of common service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Trichinopoly, with the deepest sense of reverence, he 
visited the scene of Heber&rsquo;s death, ministered at the same 
altar, and preached from the same pulpit, after an interval of 
nine years.</p>
<p>Here, his mode of dealing with the caste-question was thus: 
When he came robed into the church, he saw groups of natives 
standing about, instead of placing themselves like the others of 
the congregation.&nbsp; He went up to two, led them to seats, and
his chaplain following, did the same; the rest were seated in 
like manner without resistance.</p>
<p>When the Celebration took place, the Bishop had given 
directions as to the order of things.&nbsp; First, a Soodra 
catechist communicated, then two Pariah catechists, then an 
English gentleman, next a Pariah, then two Eurasians; and thus 
without distinction, 147 communicated.&nbsp; The barrier was 
broken down, and the nucleus of a church without caste was 
formed.</p>
<p>This presidency of Madras was immediately after formed into a 
separate see, and given to Daniel Corrie, the friend of Martyn, 
while Dr. Thomas Carr became Bishop of Bombay.</p>
<p>On Wilson&rsquo;s return to Tanjore he found an increasing 
though still small number had conformed, and before he left the 
place there were hopes of larger numbers.&nbsp; On his way back 
to Calcutta, he visited the horrible pagoda of Juggernaut 
(properly Jaghanatha, Lord of the World), which was still the 
centre of worship and pilgrimage; and though the self-immolation 
of the pilgrims beneath the car had been prohibited, yet the 
Company&rsquo;s Government still fancied themselves justified in 
receiving a toll from the visitors to this shrine of cruelty and 
all uncleanness, up to 1839, when the disgrace was done away by 
Lord Auckland.</p>
<p>In the year 1836 another journey was made, first to Bombay and
then further into the interior, to many places, never visited by 
a bishop before, and with no chaplain or anything to keep up the 
sense of religion.&nbsp; At Aurungabad, the utter ignorance of 
the English officers was appalling.&nbsp; The old 
Colonel-commandant had not heard a sermon for twenty years, <!-- 
page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
208</span>and thought every sentence on the text, &ldquo;Walk in 
love,&rdquo; was a personal attack on himself.&nbsp; He refused 
to attend another service, or to bid the Bishop farewell!&nbsp; 
And when the Holy Communion was celebrated, nobody knew what the 
offertory meant, and scarcely any one was prepared to 
respond.</p>
<p>Yet in contrast to these English, a small band of Hindoos, 
four men, six women, and five children, presented themselves, 
asking permission to join in the service, and to have their 
children baptized.&nbsp; They had been once Roman Catholics, but 
an old Dutchwoman from Ceylon had taught them most of what they 
knew; and they had a Hindostanee prayer-book, whence they held a 
service every Sunday, but leaving out the Absolution and 
Benediction, which they rightly perceived to be priestly 
functions.&nbsp; Two of them were servants to an English officer,
and they were all nearly related.&nbsp; They were perfectly 
respectable and trustworthy, and looked well dressed and 
intelligent.&nbsp; The Bishop tried to bring about an application
from the Company to the Nizam, to defray the expenses of an 
occasional visit from a chaplain to the Christian officers and 
residents in his employ, but he was answered that &ldquo;it would
form a dangerous precedent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next step was into the Bengal presidency, always with the 
same kind of adventures; quaint civilities of the presentation of
flowery garlands bedecking the neck and arms, given by the native
princes, with a sprinkling of rose-water, and sometimes an 
anointing with oil; and then an endeavour to stir into Christian 
life the neglected English military and civil officers stationed 
in their dominions.</p>
<p>One of these, a gentleman of good birth and repute, actually 
went on smoking and gurgling his hookah when the Bishop was 
beginning family prayers, apparently with no more perception that
it was anything that concerned him than if he had seen a 
Mahometan turning to Mecca, or a Parsee saluting the rising 
sun.&nbsp; Indeed many of these Company&rsquo;s servants had been
sent out when fourteen or fifteen years old; and, if in a remote 
station, had been left without anything external whatever to 
remind them of Christianity.</p>
<p>This journey extended to the Himalayas, where the Bishop had 
four months&rsquo; repose at Simlah, then in its infancy as a 
resort for wearied East Indians; and on his descent from thence, 
his first halting-place was Kurnaul, where he found the <!-- page
209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
209</span>church in a state of efficiency, owing, in great part, 
to an officer whose conversion to a religious life had been very 
remarkable.&nbsp; Once, when in a large party, where gambling was
going on to a reckless extent, he saw one of the players take out
a hideous little black figure, supposed to represent the devil, 
to which he addressed himself with a mixture of entreaties and 
threats, involving such blasphemy that this officer, utterly 
horrified, withdrew from the company, spent the night in tears 
and prayers, and from that time became a religious man.&nbsp; 
There was also an active chaplain, a large church, and a 
bungalow, built by the soldiers of an English regiment, the 
centre part arranged for service, and the surrounding verandah 
partitioned into little cells, where the soldiers could retire 
for private prayer or reading.&nbsp; It was called St. 
John&rsquo;s Chapel, and was in the hands of the chaplain.&nbsp; 
Here the Bishop remained for two Sundays, and ordained Anund 
Musseeh, who had been fifteen years a Christian, and had been 
known to Bishop Heber.&nbsp; The difficulty in his case was the 
rule not to ordain a person who had a heathen family, since he 
had not been able to convert his wife.&nbsp; His excellence 
outweighed the objection, and he was the first Brahmin who 
received holy orders from an English bishop; but in after-times 
the heathen influence at home told upon him; and this failure 
perhaps rendered Bishop Daniel Wilson somewhat over-cautious and 
backward in ordaining a native ministry.</p>
<p>The next stage was Delhi, where a very interesting interview 
awaited him.&nbsp; An officer of Anglo-Indian birth, James 
Skinner by name, who had raised and commanded a capital body of 
light horse, had twenty years before entered Delhi with a 
conquering army, and, gazing on the countless domes and minarets,
vowed that if ever he should be able, he would build an English 
church to raise its cross among them.&nbsp; He had persevered, 
though the cost far exceeded the estimate, and though the failure
of houses of business had greatly lessened his means; and now he 
came, a tall, stout, dark man of fifty-six, in a uniform of blue,
silver, and steel, a helmet on his head and a red ribbon on his 
breast, to beg for consecration for his church.&nbsp; His sons 
were Christians, but his wife was a Mahometan, though, he said 
with tears, that &ldquo;for thirty years a better wife no man 
ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church was of Greek architecture, shaped as a Greek <!-- 
page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
210</span>cross, with porticoes with flights of steps at each 
extremity except the east, which formed the chancel, and at the 
intersection was a dome and cupola.&nbsp; It was paved with 
marble, and the whole effect was beautiful.&nbsp; After the 
consecration a confirmation followed, and the first to receive 
the apostolic rite were the noble old Colonel himself and his 
three sons.&nbsp; Twenty years later this fine building was 
filled with dying men, and shared in the horrors of the siege of 
Delhi; but it has now returned to its rightful use, and as a 
church of martyrs.</p>
<p>Indeed, all the places that the Bishop visited in this 
excursion have since been associated with the Mutiny.&nbsp; 
Cawnpore was not much more satisfactory than when Heber had 
visited it; an irreligious commandant and a dissipated regiment 
had done much harm; and an imprudent letter of one of the 
chaplains had led to a quarrel, in which the clergyman 
unfortunately put himself in the wrong.&nbsp; Happily, a new 
commanding officer and better conducted regiment had replaced the
first, and the ill-feeling was so entirely removed that the 
Bishop wrote, &ldquo;Never did I enter a station with such 
despondency, nor leave one with so much joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
thus he prepared Cawnpore for that which was in store for it!</p>
<p>His visit to Allahabad was chiefly memorable for his horror at
the large resort of pilgrims to bathe in the Ganges, and at the 
tax by which a Christian government profited by their pagan 
superstition, with all its grossness and cruelty.&nbsp; He 
brought home a little ticket, with the number 76902 stamped on 
it, such as was issued to the pilgrims, and made a strong appeal 
to the Governor-General, as well as to persons in England.&nbsp; 
The next year both this tax and that on the pilgrims to 
Jaghernauth were suppressed.&nbsp; Here he heard of the death of 
Bishop Corrie, after having held the see of Madras only a year 
and a quarter, but having spent many years in India, and worked 
there for a whole lifetime, in which he had seen the very dawn of
missionary efforts, and had watched the English Church spread 
from a few scattered chaplains to three bishoprics.</p>
<p>Lord Auckland and his sisters were more sincere friends of 
Christian efforts than any Governor-General had yet been, but 
these were trying times.&nbsp; Mr. Bateman, his daughter&rsquo;s 
husband, fell ill, and his wife was obliged to return to England 
with him; the Bishop&rsquo;s other chaplain died, and also some 
of his best friends.&nbsp; On going, a few years later, to 
consecrate <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>a church at Singapore, he visited 
Moulmein, and was introduced to Dr. Judson, with whom he was very
much struck.</p>
<p>The great work connected with Daniel Wilson&rsquo;s name, as 
that of Bishop&rsquo;s College is with Middleton&rsquo;s, is the 
building of the Cathedral of Calcutta.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you 
say, my four children,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;to your 
father&rsquo;s attempting to build a cathedral to the name of the
Lord his God in this heathen land?&rdquo;&nbsp; It had been the 
desire of Bishop Middleton, but there had been too much to do 
during his nine years, and it was only now that at last the times
were ripe.&nbsp; Subscriptions were opened, and the Bishop 
devoted a large amount of his income to the fund; plans were 
drawn up, land granted freely, and on the 9th of October, 1839, 
the first stone of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral was laid by the 
Bishop.</p>
<p>Just at this time there was a most remarkable move made 
towards Christianity.&nbsp; Krishnaghur, 130 miles from Calcutta,
was the great centre of the worship of Krishna, one of the 
manifestations of Vishnu.&nbsp; Here two missionaries of the 
Church Missionary Society had been at work; and when the Bishop 
was there in 1837, he described them as having made &ldquo;a 
little beginning,&rdquo; by keeping schools and holding 
conferences with the people, but they had then no adult 
convert.&nbsp; A year after a message was brought by a native, 
entreating for further help.&nbsp; There were 1,200 seriously 
inquiring into the doctrine, with many candidates for baptism, 
and at many places around it was the same.&nbsp; In the year 
1840, the Bishop set forth to visit the spot and the adjacent 
districts, where almost all the villages seemed to be actuated by
the same impulse.&nbsp; The missionaries did their utmost to 
distinguish between mere fashion and hope of gain and a true 
faith; but after all their siftings, large numbers were ready for
baptism, and the hope was so great that the Bishop was full of 
thankful ecstasy, and could hardly sleep from agitation, joy, and
anxiety.&nbsp; One hundred and fifty converts were baptized at 
once, at a place called Anunda Bass.&nbsp; The examination was 
thus, the Bishop standing in the midst:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sinners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you hope to obtain forgiveness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the sacrifice of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;We were sinners, and Christ died in our 
stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is your heart to be changed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you renounce all idolatry, feasts, poojahs, and 
caste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we renounce them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you renounce the world, the flesh, and the 
devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you suffer for Christ&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you forgive injuries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These converts had been under preparation for more than a 
year, and seemed thoroughly convinced and fairly 
instructed.&nbsp; Therefore the baptismal service was read by Mr.
Deerr; and when the vows were reached, the Bishop turned to the 
Christians around and asked if they would be witnesses and 
godparents to these candidates; and, with one voice, they shouted
that they would.&nbsp; Each candidate was singly baptized, and 
then came up to the Bishop, by whom the words receiving him into 
the Ark of Christ&rsquo;s Church were spoken.&nbsp; At Ranobunda 
there was another baptism of 250, and, in the whole district, 
full a thousand were admitted.&nbsp; It was not in over-confident
joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo; said the Bishop, 
&ldquo;who are wheat and who are tares.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was 
impossible among so many that all should be perfect Christians, 
but it was a real foundation; the flame then lighted burns on 
steadily, and the Christian faith has a firm and strong hold in 
the district of Krishnaghur.</p>
<p>Anxieties of course crossed his work.&nbsp; The Church 
Missionary Society, after being used to control its clergy, was 
not properly ready to allow their canonical obedience to a 
Bishop; and the troubles that thus arose made him once speak of 
Heber as happy in being shielded by his early death from the 
class of vexations connected with societies.&nbsp; To his great 
grief, too, a lady who had worked for years at the education of 
girls and orphans at Calcutta seceded to the Plymouth Brethren, 
and was necessarily obliged to give up the charge.&nbsp; It was 
to him &ldquo;as if a standard-bearer fainteth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
Oxford controversy also vexed him a good deal.&nbsp; The school 
of Newton and Cecil, in which he had been brought up, was at the 
most distant point that the Church permitted from the <!-- page 
213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
213</span>doctrines of the Tracts for the Times; and few men are 
able or willing candidly to judge or appreciate opinions that 
have grown up since their own budget was completed, especially 
after they have been for some time in the exercise of 
authority.&nbsp; Thus he set his mind very strongly against all 
the clergy holding those views who came to work in the diocese; 
and thereby impeded a good deal that might have worked heartily 
with him if he had only been able to believe it, and to 
understand that the maintenance of the voice of the Church is 
truly the maintenance of the voice of Christ.</p>
<p>In November 1844, when on a visitation at Umballah, he had his
first serious illness, a fever, he being then in his sixty-sixth 
year and in the thirteenth of his residence in India.&nbsp; For 
about a week he was in great danger, but rallied, and was able to
be removed by slow stages, though not without an attack of 
inflammation on the lungs before reaching Calcutta; and his 
constitution was altogether so much shaken that he was ordered 
home, without loss of time, to recruit his health.</p>
<p>He returned to England by the Overland route, and after a 
short respite recovered much of his strength, so as to be able to
preach in many churches and appear at numerous meetings; and in a
year&rsquo;s time the vigorous old man was on his way back to his
diocese, where he arrived in time to keep the Christmas of 1846, 
just two years after he had been stricken down by fever.&nbsp; In
the October of the next year he consecrated his cathedral, 
towards which 20,000<i>l.</i> had been his own donation, half 
towards the building, half towards the endowment.&nbsp; His 
strength was not quite what it had been before, but he still had 
abundant energy, and new branches of the Church were springing up
around him; not only the three dioceses that had branched from 
his own in India, but Ceylon had a Bishop of its own, Australia 
had five, and the Cape and New Zealand and the Isle of Hong Kong 
had each received a Bishop.&nbsp; The principle had come to be 
recognized that to send out isolated workers without a head to 
organize was a plan that could hardly be reasonably expected to 
succeed; and in the long run prosperity has certainly attended 
the contrary arrangement.&nbsp; Not to speak of the Divine 
authority, the action of a body under a recognized head and 
superior on the spot must be far readier of adaptation to 
circumstances than that of a number of equals, accountable only 
to some necessarily half-informed Society at home.</p>
<p><!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>In his 73rd year, just after a visitation tour, it 
somewhat dismayed Bishop Wilson to find a letter from the Bishop 
of London sending him to consecrate the new church erected by Sir
James Brooke, at Sarawak.&nbsp; Few careers have been more 
remarkable than that of the truly great man who subdued Malay 
piracy, and gained the confidence of the natives of Borneo; and 
when the effort of the fourteen weeks&rsquo; voyage had been 
made, the Bishop returned full of joy and hope, and not long 
after, together with the Bishops of Madras and Victoria, joined 
in consecrating the missionary Bishop of Labuan to the new field 
of work there opening.&nbsp; On the last journey of his life he 
also visited Rangoon, and there consecrated the church, finding 
the clergy hard at work and numerous converts.</p>
<p>During the year 1856 he had many attacks of illness, more or 
less severe; and in December, in going across the room in haste, 
he struck himself against a wooden screen, and was thrown 
down.&nbsp; His thigh was broken, and his age was such that great
fears for his life were entertained, but he recovered, and was 
able to pray with, cheer, and comfort the many anxious hearts at 
Calcutta during the dreadful days of the Indian mutiny of 1857, 
when the churches he had consecrated were stained with the blood 
of the worshippers.</p>
<p>But there was no cause for despondency in the attitude of the 
converts.&nbsp; The districts where Christianity had been so 
widely diffused remained tranquil, and the Christians in the 
cities where the mutineers were raging did not apostatize; but, 
unless they could conceal themselves, suffered with the 
whites.&nbsp; There was a great day of fasting and humiliation 
appointed by him for the 24th of July, 1857.</p>
<p>That day Bishop Wilson preached his last sermon.&nbsp; The 
text was from Habakkuk i. 12.&nbsp; &ldquo;Art Thou not from 
everlasting, O Lord my God, mine Holy One? we shall not 
die.&nbsp; O Lord, Thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O 
mighty God, Thou hast established them for 
correction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Calcutta was then trembling under the 
tidings of the horrors of Cawnpore, the death of Sir Henry 
Lawrence, and the siege of Lucknow; and no one knew what peril 
might be the next.&nbsp; Slaughter seemed at the very gates, when
the old man stood forth to console and encourage, but yet to give
warning strong and clear that these frightful catastrophes were 
in great measure the effect of our sins, our fostering of 
heathenism, our recognition of caste, and <!-- page 215--><a 
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>were 
especially a judgment on the viciousness and irreligion that had 
been the curse of English life in India.&nbsp; It was in open 
Christianity alone that he beheld hope.</p>
<p>The day was observed by all the clergy, but the 
Governor-General for some reason declined to make it official, 
and, only when the worst of the danger was over, appointed the 
4th of October as a fast-day.&nbsp; The Bishop arranged the 
services, but was too unwell to attend them.&nbsp; This was the 
beginning of his last illness; and though he held an ordination 
some weeks later, these latter weeks were all sinking, and 
increasing feebleness.&nbsp; A sea-voyage was twice attempted, 
but without success; and on the 1st of January, 1858, his 
trembling hand wrote, &ldquo;All going on well, but I am dead 
almost.&mdash;D. C.&nbsp; Firm in hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daniel Calcutta, whom these initials indicated, wrote these 
words at half-past seven at night.&nbsp; By the same hour in the 
morning he had peacefully passed to his rest.</p>
<p>One more Bishop of Calcutta we have since mourned; though the 
shortness of his career was owing to accident, not disease or 
climate.&nbsp; But with Daniel Wilson the see of Calcutta became 
established as a metropolitan bishopric, and ceased to possess 
that character of gradual extension which rendered its first 
holders necessarily missionaries.&nbsp; True, it needs many 
subdivisions.&nbsp; Four Bishops are a scanty allowance for our 
vast Indian Empire, and the see of Calcutta has a boundary scarce
limited to the north; but these are better days than when it 
included the Cape, Australia, and New Zealand.&nbsp; The Bishop 
has now more to do with the development of old missions than with
the working of new ones; and there can be no doubt that though 
there has been much of disappointment, and the progress is very 
slow, yet progress there is.&nbsp; The older converts form more 
and more of a nucleus, and although there is a large class who 
hang about missions from interested motives, there are also 
multitudes of quiet and contented villagers whose simplicity and 
remoteness shield them from the notice of the travellers who 
sneer at Christianity and call mission reports <i>couleur de 
rose</i>, because they have been taken in by some cunning scamp 
against whom any missionary would have warned them.</p>
<p>The towns and the neighbourhood of troops are not favourable 
places for observing the effects of Christianity.&nbsp; The work 
of the schools in the great cities tells but very slowly.&nbsp; 
At present, <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>out of a hundred boys who go thither
and receive the facts of Christianity intellectually, only the 
minority are practically affected by it; and of these, some lose 
all faith in their own system, but retain it outwardly in 
deference to their families, while others try to take Christian 
morality without Christian doctrine; and only one or two perhaps 
may be sincere and open believers.&nbsp; But even if only one is 
gained, is not that an exceeding gain?&nbsp; It took three 
hundred years of apostolic teaching to make the Roman Empire 
Christian.&nbsp; Why should we &ldquo;faint, and say &rsquo;tis 
vain,&rdquo; after one hundred in India?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.&nbsp; SAMUEL MARSDEN, THE AUSTRALIAN CHAPLAIN 
AND FRIEND OF THE MAORI.</h2>
<p>It has been mentioned that the island of Australia was 
considered as an archdeaconry of the see of Calcutta.&nbsp; This 
enormous island, first discovered in 1607 by Luis de Torres, and 
inhabited only by the very lowest race of savages, appeared to 
the Government of George III. a convenient spot for forming a 
penal settlement; and in 1787 the first convict ships carried out
an instalment from the English jails to New South Wales, where 
the city of Sydney was founded by Governor Phillip.</p>
<p>As usual in those days, the provision made for the moral or 
religious training of this felon population was lamentably and 
even absurdly deficient; for it seemed to be considered, that so 
long as the criminals were safe out of England, it did not 
greatly matter to her what became of them.&nbsp; But the power of
grace is sure to work sooner or later wherever the Christian name
has been carried, and a holy man rose up, not only to fight hard 
with the mass of corruption in Australia, but to carry on the 
light to the more distant shores of the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>This good man, Samuel Marsden, was the son of a small farmer 
at Farsley, near Calverley, in Yorkshire, and was educated at the
free Grammar School at Hull by Dr. Joseph Milner, whose Church 
History used to be a standard book in the early part of this 
century.&nbsp; He began his career as a <!-- page 217--><a 
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>tradesman 
at Leeds, but his school influences had given him higher 
aspirations; and a body termed the Elland Society, whose object 
was to educate young men of small means and suitable character 
for the ministry, and whose chief supporters were Wilberforce, 
Simeon, and Thornton, selected him as one of their scholars, and 
placed him at St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&nbsp; He had 
not even taken his degree when, to his surprise, he was offered a
chaplaincy in New South Wales!&nbsp; The post was no doubt a 
difficult one to fill,&mdash;for who would willingly undertake to
be one of two clergymen sent to labour among an untamed multitude
of criminals?&mdash;and Mr. Wilberforce was, no doubt, glad to 
suggest a young man so blameless and full of zeal, and of whom, 
from personal observation at Cambridge, Mr. Simeon had so high an
opinion.</p>
<p>Samuel Marsden wished to decline it at first; but finding that
no one else would come forward to undertake the charge, he 
accepted it; and in the spring of 1793 he was ordained, and 
married, being then nearly twenty-nine years of age.&nbsp; His 
wife, Elizabeth Tristan, was thoroughly worthy of him, and ruled 
his house admirably, never calling him back from any duty, but so
managing that his open-handed charity never brought him into 
difficulties.&nbsp; They were obliged to take their passage in a 
convict ship, which was to sail from Hull.&nbsp; Marsden was 
engaged to preach in a church near the harbour, and was just 
about to enter the pulpit when the signal-gun was fired to summon
the passengers on board.&nbsp; He took off his gown, gave his arm
to his bride at her pew door, and walked to the beach, the whole 
congregation streaming out after them down to the boat, where the
young clergyman stood for a few moments ere pushing off, to give 
his parting benedictions.</p>
<p>The ship went round to Portsmouth to receive her load of 
convicts; and while she was lying there, Marsden visited the Isle
of Wight, and one Sunday preached in Brading Church.&nbsp; The 
effect of his sermon in touching the heart of one young woman was
long remembered, in consequence of a memoir of her, entitled 
&ldquo;The Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; which was drawn up 
after her death by the clergyman of her parish, the Rev. Legh 
Richmond.</p>
<p>It was as trying a voyage as Henry Martyn&rsquo;s, except that
even less was to be expected from his shipmates.&nbsp; The 
captain was unwilling to allow prayers to be read even on Sunday,
saying he <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>had never known a religious sailor; 
and though, after a time, Mr. Marsden prevailed, he never felt 
himself making much impression for good.&nbsp; One of his books 
on the voyage was the Life of David Brainerd, that torch of 
missionaries, and who proved the example which served to stir Mr.
Marsden to look beyond his own immediate field of labour, severe 
though that was, and unflinching as was his toil.</p>
<p>His arrival at Paramatta, his new home, was in the March of 
1794, when the convict system had prevailed about seven years, 
and had been sufficient to form a population disgraceful to human
nature.&nbsp; None of those endeavours to reclaim the prisoner 
which now prevail had then been attempted, and jails were schools
and hotbeds of crime, whence the transported were sent forth to 
corrupt each other more and more on board ship; and then, though 
employed on Government works or assigned to free settlers as 
servants, so soon as they had worked out their time of servitude 
they were let loose to live after their own will.</p>
<p>Such as had any capacity for steady industry soon made their 
fortunes on the parcels of land allotted to them by Government, 
to which they added by purchase; and these persons, by the 
influence of wealth and property, rose into colonial rank and 
authority, though without any such real training in the sense of 
uprightness or morality as could fit them for the posts they 
occupied.&nbsp; The least tainted by crime were the Irish, who 
had been deported by wholesale after the rebellion, some without 
even a form of trial, but these were idle and prone to violence; 
while of the regular convicts there was a large proportion 
addicted to every brutality that vice could conceive, and their 
numbers were continually being recruited by fresh shiploads after
the assizes at home.&nbsp; The only attempt at securing order and
tolerable safety was by visiting every offence, even the 
slightest, of which a convict was accused in a court of justice, 
with the most unrelenting severity; and this, of course, had the 
effect of further brutalizing these felon people, making them 
reckless of the deeds they committed, and often driving them to 
become bush-rangers&mdash;outlawed wild men of the woods&mdash;a 
terror to the colony.&nbsp; A powerful military force was kept up
to repress these wretched beings by physical force, but of moral 
training there was only what was afforded by the openings for 
industry in a new country, and religious teaching <!-- page 
219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
219</span>was represented by&mdash;two chaplains, for convicts, 
soldiers, settlers, and all!&nbsp; No wonder that the senior soon
broke down under the hopeless toil of such a position, and left 
the junior to struggle with it alone.&nbsp; And nobly he did 
struggle!&nbsp; Wilberforce had made a wise choice of a man in 
the prime of youth, whose bullet-headed portrait speaks of the 
most dogged determination, with nerves, health, and weight enough
to contend for a whole lifetime with the horrible depravity 
around him&mdash;the only clergyman, and with three settlements 
far apart dependent on his ministry.&nbsp; And in the outset he 
was severely tried by domestic sorrows; for his eldest son, at 
two years old, was thrown out of his mother&rsquo;s arms by a 
jolt to the carriage over the rough road, and killed on the spot;
and a younger child, who was shortly after left at home from 
dread of a similar accident, was allowed by its attendant to 
stray into the kitchen, where it fell backwards into a pan of 
boiling water and was fatally scalded.</p>
<p>The father bore these calamities as one who had steadfast 
faith and resignation&mdash;&ldquo;one who felt much and said 
little.&rdquo;&nbsp; The demands on his time, indeed, left him no
leisure for giving way to grief.&nbsp; Spiritual matters were not
all that came upon him.&nbsp; In the utter lack of conscientious 
men to perform the functions of the magistracy, he was at once 
appointed to the bench; nor, indeed, was there the same feeling 
in England then as now against the combination of the clergyman 
and justice of the peace.&nbsp; The most exemplary parish priests
viewed it as a duty to administer justice in their villages; and 
the first, and till quite recently the sole manual of prayers to 
be used with prisoners, was the production of one of these 
clerical magistrates.&nbsp; A Yorkshire farmer&rsquo;s son could 
not be expected to know much about law, but good sense, 
uprightness, perception of justice, and intense determination, he
had, as well as Christian humanity; and in these he was superior 
to any of his colleagues on the Paramatta bench, whom he was 
continually striving to raise to some comprehension of the 
commonest rules of justice, mercy, and decency; and in this, 
after a long course of years, he in some measure succeeded; but 
not till after his strong hand, impartial justice, and hatred of 
vice, had made him enemies among all parties; and it is only too 
probable that his secular authority, though always nobly wielded,
impeded rather than otherwise his pastoral influence.</p>
<p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>His farming education served him well when he received 
a grant of land, and of thirteen convicts to bring it into 
order.&nbsp; It was part of his payment, almost indispensable for
procuring to his family the necessaries of life, and it gave him,
besides, the means of imparting instruction in honest 
labour.&nbsp; His property became the model farm of New South 
Wales, and the profits afforded him the means of establishing the
schools, benevolent institutions, and missions, for which there 
were few, if any purses to draw upon.&nbsp; He won himself 
respect on all sides, especially from the Governor of the colony,
Captain King, a hasty, violent, but good-hearted man, with whom 
more than once he had misunderstandings, but such as were made up
again.&nbsp; On one of these occasions, the chaplain&rsquo;s 
advice was asked by the Governor, and promised on condition that 
he might speak as to a private individual.&nbsp; So, when they 
met, Mr. Marsden locked the door, and, in plain and forcible 
terms, gave <i>Captain</i> King a thoroughgoing remonstrance on 
the faults of <i>Governor</i> King, which was taken in perfect 
good part.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the whole construction of Society was so 
atrocious, that nothing could effect any improvement but 
interference from higher authority.&nbsp; The Court of Judicature
in New South Wales was the most shamelessly corrupt and abandoned
in existence, and a rebellious spirit broke out which imperilled 
the military authority of the Governor.&nbsp; Mr. Marsden saw no 
hope, except in laying a full statement in person before the home
Government; and therefore, at the end of fourteen years, when 
Governor King was about to return home, he resolved to go 
himself, and make a strong personal representation to 
Government.&nbsp; The two families sailed in the same ship, the 
<i>Buffalo</i>, which proved to be leaky; and, when a heavy gale 
was expected, it was proposed that the passengers should quit 
her, and take refuge in a stronger vessel; but Mrs. King was too 
unwell to be moved, and Mrs. Marsden would not leave her, so that
the proposal was abandoned, and most providentially, for the ship
that had been thought secure was lost in the night and never seen
more!</p>
<p>The voyage was a slow one; and the first thing Mr. Marsden 
heard on arriving was, that the insurrection he had expected had 
actually broken out.&nbsp; This rendered Lord Castlereagh, then 
Colonial Secretary, the more anxious to obtain the advice of a 
sensible, clear-headed man like Samuel Marsden, and he was <!-- 
page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
221</span>encouraged to explain his views.&nbsp; First, he was 
anxious for whatever would tend to reform the convicts; and 
having observed that the most respectable of these were such as 
had married, or whose wives had come out to them, he begged that,
for the future, the families of the married men might be sent out
with them.&nbsp; This was refused; but his representation that 
the convicts ought to be instructed in trades was attended to, 
when he showed that, by this means, the whole expense of their 
clothing might be saved.&nbsp; He had discerned the wonderful 
capacities of Australia for sheep farming, and having brought 
home some wool, and found it much approved by the manufacturers, 
he thereupon ventured to petition the King for a couple of merino
<a name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221" 
class="citation">[221]</a> sheep from the royal farm at Windsor, 
to improve the breed.&nbsp; The request was after &ldquo;Farmer 
George&rsquo;s&rdquo; own heart; he gave five, and thus Mr. 
Marsden did the work of agricultural improvement of the 
Benedictines of old.&nbsp; He also obtained that three more 
clergymen and three schoolmasters should be sent out; and he 
strove hard for other institutions, chiefly for the reformation 
of the female convicts, which he could not at the time get 
carried out.&nbsp; He likewise conducted an immense 
correspondence on behalf of persons who had not found any other 
means of communicating with their homes; and, at the same time, 
he became personally acquainted with Wilberforce, and many others
of the supporters of the cause of religion.</p>
<p>Above all, it was in this visit to England that Mr. Marsden 
laid the foundations of the missions to New Zealand, and prepared
to become the apostle of the Maori race.&nbsp; These great 
islands of New Zealand had been discovered and named by Tasman in
1642, and first visited by Captain Cook in 1769.&nbsp; He found 
them inhabited by a brave, high-spirited, and quick-witted set of
natives, with as large a proportion of the fine qualities 
sometimes found in a wild race as ever savages possessed, but 
their tribes continually at war, and the custom of cannibalism 
prevailing: he had been on friendly terms with them, and 
presented them with pigs, fowls, and potatoes&mdash;no small boon
in a land where there was no quadruped bigger than a rat, and 
very few esculent vegetables.&nbsp; From this time, whalers <!-- 
page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
222</span>occasionally stopped to take in water, &amp;c., and 
kept up a sort of intercourse with the Maori, sometimes amiable, 
and resulting in the natives taking voyages on board the vessels,
but sometimes quarrelsome, and characterized by mutual outrages, 
when, if a white man were made prisoner, he was sure to be killed
and eaten, to serve as a sort of triumphal and sacrificial 
banquet.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was plain that these Maories were of a much 
higher type of humanity than the Australian natives, whom Mr. 
Marsden had found so far entirely unteachable and untameable, but
for whom he was trying to establish some plan of training and 
protection.&nbsp; Such a spirit of curiosity and enterprise 
possessed some of the New Zealand chieftains, that they would 
come on visits to Australia, and on these occasions Mr. Marsden 
always gave them a welcome at his parsonage at Paramatta.&nbsp; 
At one time there were thirty staying there, over whom he had 
great influence.&nbsp; Once, when he was absent from home, the 
nephew of one of the chiefs died, and his uncle immediately 
prepared to sacrifice a slave; nor could Mrs. Marsden prevent it,
otherwise than by hiding the intended victim till her husband 
came home, who made the chief understand that it was not to be 
done, though the man continued to lament that his nephew was 
deprived of his proper attendant in the other world, and seemed 
afraid to return home, lest the father of the youth should 
reproach him with the omission.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden made known all that he had been able to gather of 
the promising nature of the field of labour in New Zealand, and 
sought aid from the Church Missionary Society, since the Society 
for the Propagation of the Gospel was then unable to reach beyond
the colonies.&nbsp; The almost universal indifference of the 
upper classes to missionary labour was terribly crippling in the 
matter of means; and perhaps the fact was that the underbred 
class of agents of the Societies stirred up by the example of 
Marshman and Carey, together with the vulgarly-sensational 
appeals against which Ward&rsquo;s good taste so strongly 
protested, greatly tended to make them incredulous.&nbsp; It was 
not till the statements of scholars and gentlemen, like Henry 
Martyn and Bishop Heber, became generally known, that the work 
was looked on without sarcasm, provoked by vulgarity, even where 
there was great devotion.</p>
<p>No clergyman could be found to undertake the mission to New 
Zealand; but William Hall and John King, two laymen, <!-- page 
223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
223</span>undertook to act as pioneers, with instructions to 
establish family worship, converse on religion with the natives, 
and instruct their children; trying, at the same time, to show 
the benefits of civilization, but to take care it was not 
confounded with Christianity.</p>
<p>These two good men, who were presently followed by Thomas 
Kendall, sailed in the same ship with Mr. Marsden, when, in 
August 1809, he paid his last farewell to his native land, and 
sailed in the <i>Ann</i> for New South Wales.&nbsp; Strange to 
say, this very ship contained a Maori, on his return home!&nbsp; 
He was a young chief named Duaterra, who had, in a spirit of 
adventure, embarked on board a whaler named the <i>Argo</i>, and 
worked as a sailor for six months, till the captain, having no 
further occasion for his services, put him ashore at Port 
Jackson, without payment or friends.&nbsp; However, he embarked 
in another whaler, and worked his way home, but soon was on board
of a third English ship, the <i>Santa Anna</i>, in search of 
seal-skins, and having conceived a great desire to see the 
country whence these vessels came forth, and to know its chief, 
he engaged to come to England in it, the captain and sailors not 
scrupling to promise him an introduction to King George.&nbsp; 
When the <i>Santa Anna</i> reached England, the crew had grown 
tired of him, used him roughly and harshly, and tried to put him 
off his pertinacious recollection of the promise of seeing the 
king, by telling him that King George&rsquo;s house could not be 
found; while he was worked beyond his strength, and scarcely ever
suffered to go on shore.&nbsp; When, in fifteen days, the cargo 
was all discharged, the captain put him on board the <i>Ann</i>, 
to be taken back to Australia, and when he asked for his wages, 
to provide some clothing, told him that the owner of the ship 
would give him two muskets when he should reach Port Jackson.</p>
<p>The poor fellow was little likely to reach it, for lung 
disease, the great foe of the Maori, had set in; and he was in a 
pitiable condition when Mr. Marsden, by chance, remarked his 
brown face on the forecastle, and inquired into his history, 
which was confirmed by the master of the <i>Ann</i>, and was 
really only a specimen of a sailor&rsquo;s vague promises, and 
incapacity to understand that a dark skin ought to be treated 
with the same justice as a white one.&nbsp; Duaterra was a man of
much intelligence, and even under these most unfavourable 
circumstances had been greatly impressed with the civilization of
England, and was so desirous of improvement that, on arriving at 
Port Jackson, Mr. <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>Marsden took him to his farm, where 
he applied eagerly to the learning of husbandry.</p>
<p>Duaterra was not the only Maori ill-treated by British 
sailors.&nbsp; Another chief having been used in like manner, or 
worse, on board the <i>Boyd</i>, bided his time till the ship was
in the Bay of Islands, and then brought his tribe, armed with 
clubs and hatchets, to revenge his sufferings.&nbsp; They 
overpowered the crew, slaughtered and feasted upon them, burning 
the ship, and only retaining as captives two women and a 
boy.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Hall and King were ready to take the 
missionaries to this dangerous spot, but Mr. Marsden thought it 
best to give time for the passions thus excited to cool down.</p>
<p>Meantime Governor Macquarie had come out to take charge of New
South Wales.&nbsp; He was a man of great determination and 
despotic will, and carried out many regulations that were of 
exceeding benefit to the colony, but he did not know the limits 
of his authority, dealt with the chaplains as with subordinate 
officials, and sometimes met with staunch opposition from the 
sturdy Yorkshireman, his senior chaplain, so that they were in a 
state of almost constant feud throughout his government, although
at the end of his career he bore the strongest testimony to the 
merits of the only man who durst resist him.&nbsp; The old game 
of Ambrose and Theodosius, Hildebrand and Henry, Becket and 
Plantagenet, has to be played over and over again, wherever the 
State refuses to understand that spiritual matters lie beyond its
grasp; and when Governor Macquarie prescribed the doctrines to be
preached and the hymns to be used in the churches, and commanded 
the most unsuitable secular notices to be promulgated by the 
clergy, if Mr. Marsden had not resisted the Church would have 
been absolutely degraded.&nbsp; When convicts of wealth and 
station, but still leading most vicious lives, were raised to the
magistrates&rsquo; bench, Mr. Marsden could not but refuse to 
associate or act with them, and even tendered his resignation of 
the magistracy, but Macquarie would not accept it.&nbsp; How 
uncompromising these sermons were is evidenced by an anecdote of 
a man, who, being stung to the quick, fancied that the words had 
been individually aimed at him, and determined to be 
revenged.&nbsp; Accordingly, as soon as he saw the chaplain 
riding near a piece of water he jumped in, and when Mr. Marsden 
at once sprung after him, did his utmost to drown his intended 
deliverer; but after a violent struggle the Yorkshire <!-- page 
225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
225</span>muscles prevailed, and the man was dragged out, so 
startled by the shock that he confessed his intention, and, under
the counsel he had so fiercely spurned at first, became truly 
penitent, and warmly attached to Mr. Marsden, whose service he 
ultimately entered.</p>
<p>The square short face and sturdy form of Samuel Marsden show 
the force, vigour, and determination of his nature, which told on
beast as well as man.&nbsp; On the road between Sydney and 
Paramatta, he used to let the reins lie loose on the splash-board
of his gig and read, saying that &ldquo;the horse that could not 
keep itself up was not worth driving,&rdquo; and though one of 
the pair he usually drove was unmanageable in other hands, 
nothing ever went amiss with it when it went out with its 
master.&nbsp; Such a spirit of determination produced an impress 
even on those who opposed him most, and many works were carried 
out in the teeth of the difficulties thrown in their way; such as
the erection of schools, of a factory for the reception of the 
female convicts, and of a sort of model farm, where it was 
intended to collect, tame, and civilize the aborigines.&nbsp; 
This was at first planned between the governor and chaplain, but 
when it was ready Marsden was under Colonel Macquarie&rsquo;s 
displeasure, and was therefore excluded from all share in the 
management, though the site was actually in his own parish of 
Paramatta.&nbsp; The experiment was a failure, probably not on 
this account, but from the restless character of the blacks, 
whose intellect was too small, and their wants too few, to feel 
any comfort a compensation for their freedom and wandering 
life.&nbsp; Mr. Marsden and the other chaplains repeatedly tried 
bringing up children,&mdash;some too young to retain any memory 
of their native habits, but they always relapsed into savage life
on the first opportunity, and though here and there individuals 
may have better come up to the hopes of their devoted friends, 
yet as a race they seem too little above the animal to be 
susceptible of being raised.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie was an iron-handed man, who could not brook
opposition, or endure any scheme that did not originate with 
himself.&nbsp; So when Mr. Marsden laid before him a project for 
diminishing the appalling misery and vice in which the utter 
neglect of Government left the female convicts, he acknowledged 
the letter, but did not act upon it.&nbsp; After waiting eighteen
months for him to take some measure, the chaplain sent a 
statement of the condition of these poor creatures to <!-- page 
226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
226</span>the Colonial Office; it was laid before Parliament, and
Lord Bathurst, the Colonial Secretary, sent a letter of inquiry 
to the Governor.&nbsp; Macquarie&rsquo;s fury was intense on 
finding that the chaplain had dared to look above and beyond him;
and he gave a willing encouragement to whatever resisted the 
attempts of Marsden at establishing some sense of religion and 
morality.&nbsp; After refusing to accept his resignation of his 
post as a magistrate, he dismissed him ignominiously, and all the
underlings of Government knew that any attack from them would be 
regarded with favour.&nbsp; A vile and slanderous letter, full of
infamous libels, not only against Samuel Marsden, as a man and a 
Christian priest, but against the missionaries, and signed 
&ldquo;Philo-free,&rdquo; appeared in the <i>Sydney Herald</i>, 
the Government paper, and was traced to Macquarie&rsquo;s own 
secretary!&nbsp; The libel was such that Mr. Marsden felt it due 
to his cause to bring an action against the publisher, and in 
spite of the prejudice against him, after a trial of three days, 
he gained a complete victory and damages of &pound;200; but the 
newspaper published such a false and scandalous report of the 
trial that he was obliged a second time to prosecute, and again 
obtained a verdict in his favour.</p>
<p>The officers of the 46th Regiment, on leaving the colony, 
presented him with a testimonial, and an address most gratifying,
amid the general obloquy, and showing a feeling most honourable 
to themselves.&nbsp; Every one who cared for the cause of virtue 
at home, especially Wilberforce, Simeon, and Mrs. Fry, wrote 
encouraging letters to him; and Lord Bathurst, on receiving a 
despatch from Macquarie, full of charges against the chaplain as 
man, magistrate, and minister, sent out a commission of inquiry, 
which, coming with fresh eyes from England, was horrified at the 
abuses to which the Australian world was accustomed, found every 
word of Mr. Marsden&rsquo;s perfectly justified, and at last 
extracted the following confession from Colonel Macquarie: 
&ldquo;The Governor admits that Mr. Marsden&rsquo;s manner to him
has been constantly civil and accommodating, and that nothing in 
his manner could provoke the Governor&rsquo;s warmth.&nbsp; The 
Governor admits his qualifications, his activity, and his 
unremitting vigilance as a magistrate, and in society his 
cheerful disposition and readiness to please.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
report of this commission resulted, among other more important 
consequences, in the unsolicited grant of &pound;400 a year 
additional stipend to Mr. <!-- page 227--><a 
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>Marsden, 
&ldquo;in consideration of his long, laborious, and praiseworthy 
exertions in behalf of religion and morality.&rdquo;&nbsp; This 
was only fitting compensation on the part of Government, for the 
accusation of avarice had brought to light how many schools and 
asylums, the proper work of the Government, had been built, and 
were being maintained, out of the proceeds of the farm which had 
prospered so excellently.</p>
<p>As long as Macquarie continued in office, Mr. Marsden was out 
of favour, but Sir Thomas Brisbane, who came out in 1821, was 
friendly with him, and knew his value, insisting on his returning
to the bench of magistrates.&nbsp; He did all he could to avoid 
it, till the judges and almost every one in the colony so urged 
him to accept that he yielded; but in 1824 a case occurred in 
which a rich and insolent culprit was severely punished by the 
Paramatta bench, and contrived to raise such an outrageous storm 
that Sir Thomas Brisbane, who, if better disposed, was more timid
than his predecessor, dismissed the whole five magistrates.&nbsp;
The offender&rsquo;s wish had been merely to overthrow Mr. 
Marsden, but this was found impossible.&nbsp; The whole fury of 
the colony again rose against this fearless man, and accusations 
absolutely absurd were trumped up.&nbsp; One was that he allowed 
his windmill to work on Sunday!&nbsp; The fact turned out to be, 
when investigated, that somebody had once seen the sails turning 
on a Sunday, some time before Mr. Marsden had purchased the land 
on which the mill stood.&nbsp; A real act of persecution affected
him more seriously, as it was the ruin of another person in whom 
he was interested.&nbsp; There was an old regulation forbidding 
the hiring out of convicts who were assigned to residents as 
domestic servants, but this had been virtually repealed by 
another under Macquarie, permitting such hiring out on the owners
complying with certain rules.&nbsp; These had been duly attended 
to by Mr. Marsden in the case of one James Ring, a plumber and 
glazier, who, as a reward for good conduct, was allowed to go out
to work in Paramatta for his own profit.&nbsp; Being ill-used and
beaten by another servant, he summoned the man before the bench 
of magistrates, but these, who had been put in when Mr. Marsden 
and his colleagues were dismissed, immediately committed Ring to 
jail for being at large.&nbsp; His master went to demand his 
release, showing that the rules had been observed, but the 
magistrates replied by levying a fine of two-and-sixpence for 
every day that Ring had been at work, <!-- page 228--><a 
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>and as 
Marsden did not offer to pay, they sent a convict constable to 
his house to seize property to that amount, while poor Ring 
himself was sent to work in irons with the penal gang; though at 
that very moment one of the magistrates had a servant, a tailor, 
at work in Mr. Marsden&rsquo;s house; and another person had two 
hired convicts of another of these justices employed at his 
home.&nbsp; In fact, it was the only sentence of the kind ever 
inflicted, yet Sir Thomas Brisbane was afraid to interfere; 
whereupon Mr. Marsden caused his case to be tried before the 
Supreme Court, and so completely proved it, that restitution of 
the illegal fine was commanded, though the spirit of persecution 
was still shown in the absurdly small sum of damages allotted to 
him.&nbsp; What was worse was that he could not procure the 
release of Ring, for while he was sending an appeal to England 
the unhappy man lost patience, ran away from the gang where he 
was working in irons on the roads, and escaped to New Zealand, 
but was never heard of more.&nbsp; Had he but borne with his 
misery a little longer he would have been restored to his kind 
master, for a commission came out which a second time resulted in
the complete triumph of Mr. Marsden, and the entire discomfiture 
of his persecutors.</p>
<p>We have gone through the history of his home troubles before 
entering on the part that concerned his missionary labours.&nbsp;
It is a painful picture, but the staunch firmness that never 
failed to &ldquo;boldly rebuke vice,&rdquo; is too essential a 
part of the picture to be passed over.&nbsp; The Apostle of New 
Zealand was the Baptist of the Herods of Australia.&nbsp; We 
return to the year 1816, when, after some months&rsquo; training 
in agriculture at Mr. Marsden&rsquo;s farm, Duaterra had sailed 
for his home, but only again to suffer from the perfidy of the 
master of the ship.&nbsp; The ordinary English mind seemed 
incapable of perceiving that any faith need be kept with a 
dark-coloured man, and Duaterra was defrauded of his share of the
oil procured from the whales he had helped to catch, carried past
his own shores, only two miles from the <i>pah</i> where the 
master had engaged to land him, and turned adrift in the then 
uninhabited Norfolk Island, where a whaler picked him up almost 
starved, and brought him back to Australia.&nbsp; However, Mr. 
Marsden found another ship, which did fulfil its engagements, and
Duaterra was at last set ashore in the Bay of Islands, close to 
the northern point of New Zealand, with a supply of wheat which 
Mr. Marsden had given him.</p>
<p><!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>Two years had passed, and Mr. Marsden had been trying 
to procure from the Society at home a mission ship to carry 
teachers to the islands, visit them, and supply their wants 
there, but he had not as yet succeeded, and he therefore decided 
on purchasing a small one from Australia at his own 
expense.&nbsp; This was the <i>Active</i>, the first of the 
mission vessels that now bear the Cross in several quarters of 
the globe.&nbsp; In her Hall and King sailed, and Mr. Marsden 
would have accompanied them but for the express prohibition of 
Governor Macquarie, who, little as he loved his senior chaplain, 
did not choose to lose him on what he regarded as a scheme of 
almost fanatic folly.&nbsp; The two teachers were not to settle 
on shore, nor even to sleep there, but they were to visit 
Duaterra, reconnoitre the ground, and see whether it would be 
possible to settle there as they had at first proposed.</p>
<p>To their delight, Duaterra came eagerly to meet them, very 
anxious for their assistance with his corn.&nbsp; He had shown it
to his tribe, telling them that hence came the bread and biscuit 
they had eaten in English ships, and great had been their 
disappointment when neither the ear nor the root of the wheat 
proved at all like these articles.&nbsp; However, he had been 
successful in his farmer operations, but was entirely puzzled by 
those of the miller, only knowing that the grain ought to be 
ground, and unable to contrive it, though he had borrowed a 
coffee-mill from a trading vessel.&nbsp; When the new comers 
produced a hand-mill he was delighted.&nbsp; His kindred, to whom
he had been a laughing-stock for averring that biscuit had any 
connection with his new grass, crowded round incredulously to 
watch the mill, showed unbounded amazement as the white flour 
streamed forth, and when a cake was hastily made and baked in a 
frying-pan they leapt about shouting and dancing for joy.&nbsp; 
Duaterra, his uncle Hunghi, a very powerful chief, and five more,
accepted an invitation to come and confer with Mr. Marsden, and 
the <i>Active</i> brought them back to New South Wales.&nbsp; 
They were very anxious for the benefits which they hoped to 
derive from intercourse with the whites, and readily undertook to
secure Hall and King from all danger.&nbsp; Even Governor 
Macquarie was so far satisfied that he consented to let Mr. 
Marsden go out and arrange the new settlement, to which he 
presented two cows and a bull.&nbsp; These, with three horses, 
and some sheep and poultry, were embarked on board the 
<i>Active</i>, with a motley <!-- page 230--><a 
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>collection 
of passengers, the eight Maories, the three missionaries with 
their wives and children, a sawyer, a smith, Mr. Marsden, and 
another gentleman named John Lydiard Nicholas, the master of the 
vessel, his wife, son, and crew, which included two Tahitians, 
and lastly a runaway convict who had secreted himself on 
board.&nbsp; Their arrival might have been rendered dangerous by 
the conduct of a whaling crew at Wangaroa, in the northern island
of New Zealand, who, by way of retaliation for the massacre of 
the <i>Boyd&rsquo;s</i> ship-company, had murdered a chief named 
Tippahee with all his family, without waiting to find out whether
he had been concerned in the slaughter.&nbsp; Nevertheless, these
brave men were ready to dare to the utmost, and the fame of Mr. 
Marsden, &ldquo;the friend of the Maori,&rdquo; had preceded him,
and the <i>Active</i> was welcomed with presents of fish and 
visits from the natives.</p>
<p>They found that Tippahee&rsquo;s people at Wangaroa had 
accused the tribe of the Bay of Islands of leading the English to
murder their chief, that there was in consequence a deadly feud, 
and that several desperate battles had been fought.&nbsp; Marsden
knew that if he came as the friend of Duaterra and his tribe 
alone, party spirit would entirely alienate the rest of the 
islanders, and he therefore determined at once to prove that he 
came not as the ally of one party, but as the friend of 
both.&nbsp; He therefore determined to prove to the Wangaroans 
his confidence in them by not only landing among them unarmed, 
but actually spending the night among them.&nbsp; His friend Mr. 
Nicholas accompanied him in this, one of the most intrepid 
actions ever performed, when it is remembered that this tribe 
consisted of the cannibals who had eaten his own countrymen, and 
had of late been freshly provoked.&nbsp; The two gentlemen supped
in Hunghi&rsquo;s hut on potatoes and fish, and then quietly 
walked over to the hostile camp, where they met with a friendly 
welcome.&nbsp; One of the natives who had sailed in an English 
vessel was able to interpret, and with his assistance Mr. Marsden
explained the purpose of the missionaries, and the desirableness 
of peace.&nbsp; Maories appreciate being spoken to at length and 
with due respect, and they listened politely, making speeches in 
their own fashion in return, until towards eleven, when most had 
gone to rest.&nbsp; The two Englishmen wrapped themselves in 
their great coats and lay down, the interpreter bidding them lie 
near him.&nbsp; It was a clear night, countless stars shining 
above, the sea in front smooth, all around a forest of spears 
stuck upright in the <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>earth, and on the ground the 
multitude of human beings in their scanty loose garb of tapa 
cloth lying fast asleep, while the man who had come as an apostle
to them spent the night in thought and prayer.&nbsp; Such a scene
can never be forgotten!</p>
<p>In the morning the ship&rsquo;s boat came to fetch him off, 
and he took the chiefs back with him to the ship to receive 
presents and be introduced to those who were to live among 
them.&nbsp; There was also a formal reconciliation with Duaterra 
and his tribe, and the wondering Maories took their travelled 
brother into high estimation when they really beheld the animals 
they had imagined to be mere creations of his fancy, and were 
specially amazed at the sight of Mr. Marsden mounted on 
horseback.</p>
<p>Duaterra, meantime, of his own accord, was making preparations
for the first Sunday service held in New Zealand.&nbsp; It was 
likewise the Christmas Day of 1815, and Mr. Marsden felt it a 
most appropriate moment for his first proclamation of the good 
tidings of great joy among this most distant of the 
nations.&nbsp; Duaterra&rsquo;s ideas of a church consisted in 
enclosing about half an acre of land with a fence, and erecting 
in the midst a reading-desk three feet, and a pulpit six feet 
high, both made out of canoes, covered with either black native 
cloth or some canvas he had brought from Port Jackson, and 
ranging near them some bottoms of old canoes, as seats for the 
English part of the congregation, and on the hill above he 
hoisted, of his own accord, the British flag.</p>
<p>On the Sunday morning Duaterra, his uncle, and Koro Koro, 
another chief who had been in Australia, all appeared in 
regimentals given them by Governor Macquarie, swords by their 
sides, and switches in their hands, and all their men drawn up 
behind them.&nbsp; When the English had entered, the chiefs 
arranged their tribes, and Mr. Marsden began by singing the Old 
Hundredth Psalm, the first note of praise to the Creator that 
ever rung from the bays and rocks of New Zealand.&nbsp; Then he 
went through the Christmas Day service, his twenty-two English 
joining in it, and Koro Koro making signs with his switch to the 
natives when to stand and when to sit.&nbsp; Mr. Marsden ended 
with a sermon on the Angelic greeting, and when the natives 
complained that they could not understand, Duaterra promised to 
explain afterwards, and this he performed&mdash;it may be feared,
after a fashion of his own, for as yet he was very ignorant, 
although very acute.</p>
<p><!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>Mr. Marsden&rsquo;s principle was not that of Eliot, to
begin with the faith, then come to civilization.&nbsp; He thought
that the benefits of civilization would lead to the acceptance of
the faith; and, besides, he had only laymen to act as teachers; 
and, as his system was that of the Church, he could only employ 
them in laying foundations, in preparing instead of admitting 
converts, while his own duties only permitted of his making 
flying visits.&nbsp; So he established his settlers to show the 
benefits of peace, industry, and morality, and thus bring the 
natives to look higher.&nbsp; Seed, tools, clothing, he assisted 
them in procuring and using, but his smith was expressly 
forbidden ever to make or repair any warlike weapon, or the 
settlers ever to barter muskets or powder for any possession of 
whatever value with the natives.&nbsp; He likewise strove, in his
conversations with the chiefs, to show the evils of their vices 
in such a manner as their shrewd minds could enter into, trying 
to make them see the disgrace and horror of cannibalism, and the 
inconveniences of polygamy, thus hoping to raise their 
standard.</p>
<p>In order that the mission settlement might have some security,
he purchased a plot of land in the name of the Church Missionary 
Society, drawing up a regular deed of sale, to which his 
signature was affixed, together with a likeness of the tattooed 
pattern of the Maori chieftain&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Duaterra 
walked about with him in delight, talking of the time when the 
church should be built, and planning the spot; but the poor 
fellow had probably never recovered the injury his constitution 
had suffered, for he fell ill, and his state was soon 
hopeless.&nbsp; It was a great grief to Mr. Marsden, who had 
reckoned much on his assistance, and found it hard to acquiesce 
in the will of Providence, more especially as the poor young man 
was not yet so entirely a Christian as to warrant baptizing 
him.&nbsp; He begged Mr. Marsden to pray with him, but he kept 
his heathen priest at hand, and his mind was tossed to and fro 
between the new truth and the old superstition.&nbsp; In this 
state Mr. Marsden was forced to leave him, four days before his 
death, when Kendall, who visited him to the last, was shocked at 
the savage manner in which his relatives gashed themselves, to 
show their grief, and far more when his favourite wife stole out 
and hung herself, according to a frequent custom, regarded as 
rather honourable than otherwise!</p>
<p>Soon after his death fresh wars broke out, and a hostile <!-- 
page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
233</span>tribe encamped near the mission settlement, loudly 
threatening to kill and devour the inhabitants, who, for months 
together, had to keep watch day and night, put their children to 
bed in their clothes ready for instant flight, and had their boat
always afloat with oars and sails; but they remained steadfast, 
and the danger passed over.</p>
<p>The <i>Active</i> plied backwards and forwards, supplying them
with the necessaries of life, and bringing guests to the farm at 
Paramatta, where Mr. Marsden provided instruction for them.&nbsp;
Two, named Tooi and Teterree, were sent in charge of Mr. Nicholas
to visit England in a King&rsquo;s ship, where they had learnt to
speak English tolerably, and to follow the customs of civilized 
society.&nbsp; They were gentle and intelligent, and eager to 
learn, but no one could reckon on what would interest or excite 
them.&nbsp; They were taken to see St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, 
which did not seem to strike them at all; but, as they were 
walking along Fleet Street, they came to a sudden stand before a 
hairdresser&rsquo;s shop, screaming out, &ldquo;Women, 
women,&rdquo; as they beheld the display of waxen busts, which 
they thought did credit to the Pakeha, or English, style of 
preserving dried human heads!&nbsp; Like Duaterra, their great 
anxiety was to see King George; but, in 1817, the apology 
recorded in Teterree&rsquo;s English letter was only too 
true,&mdash;&ldquo;I never see the King of England, he very 
poorly; and Queen Charlotte very poorly too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On their return to Paramatta, Mr. Marsden made a second visit 
to New Zealand, taking them back, and also going to instal some 
fresh missionaries and mechanics on a new settlement.&nbsp; There
was great competition among the chiefs; for the possession of a 
Pakeha, or Englishman, was greatly coveted as a means of bringing
the material good things of life, and Mr. Marsden was eagerly 
assured that there was no danger of the English being killed and 
eaten, since the Maori flesh was much sweeter, because the whites
ate so much salt.&nbsp; There was as yet no convert, but Mr. 
Marsden&rsquo;s resolution by no means failed him; he 
believed&mdash;and he was right&mdash;that kindness, truth, and 
uprightness, in those who could confer temporal benefits, would, 
in time, lead these intelligent men to appreciate the spiritual 
blessings that were offered to them.</p>
<p>Presents of hoes, with which to plant the sweet potato, were 
greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Hunghi&rsquo;s head wife was working 
away with a wooden spade, though perfectly blind, and was 
delighted <!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>with the new instrument.&nbsp; 
Indeed, Hunghi was one of the most eager friends of the mission, 
though the splendidly tattooed heads of his enemies decorated his
abode, and he defended cannibalism, on the ground that animals 
preyed upon one another, and that the gods devoured each 
other.&nbsp; His manners had all the high-bred courtesy that 
marked the chief, and he was a noble-looking creature, full of 
native majesty and gentleness.&nbsp; Every hope was entertained 
of him, and he was sent, in 1820, to visit England, where he had 
an interview with George IV., and received presents of weapons 
from him.&nbsp; But the moral Hunghi brought home was, 
&ldquo;There is but one king in England.&nbsp; There shall be but
one in New Zealand.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this consummation he 
endeavoured to bring about by challenging a hostile chief whom he
met on his way back from Sydney to New Zealand.&nbsp; He gained 
the battle, by arranging his men in the form of a wedge, and 
likewise by the number of muskets with which he was able to arm 
them.&nbsp; When the chief himself fell by his hand, he drank his
fresh blood, and devoured his eye, in the belief that it thus 
became a star in the firmament, and conferred glory on himself; 
and the whole battle-field was covered with the ovens in which 
his followers cooked the flesh of the prisoners whom they did not
keep as slaves!</p>
<p>This horrible scene took place while Mr. Marsden was in 
Australia, but he could hardly have prevented it.&nbsp; Probably 
the chief&rsquo;s ferocity, so long repressed, was in a state of 
reaction; for, though the missionaries were not molested, their 
efforts seemed lost.&nbsp; Hunghi declared that he wished his 
children to learn to fight, not to read; and the Maoris insisted 
on being paid for any service to the missionaries in fire-arms 
and powder.&nbsp; When this was refused they became insolent and 
mischievous, intruding into the houses, demanding food, breaking 
down the fences, and stealing whatever they could seize; and 
there was reason to fear that any excitement might lead to 
absolute danger.&nbsp; In this crisis some of the missionaries 
failed, sold ammunition, and otherwise were wanting in the 
testimony they were intended to maintain.&nbsp; The tidings 
determined Mr. Marsden on making a fourth visit to New Zealand: 
and this time he was able to take with him a clergyman, the Rev. 
Henry Williams, who lived to become Bishop of a Maori 
district.&nbsp; It was nine years since the first landing there, 
and, in spite of all <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>disappointments, he found many of 
the natives much improved, and the friendly chiefs quite able to 
understand his prohibition against the sale of powder, although 
they were at first inclined to be angry at his having sent home a
missionary on that account.&nbsp; The other missionaries 
expressed repentance for their errors, but he was not thoroughly 
satisfied with them, though allowing much for their isolation 
from Christian society and ordinances.</p>
<p>A Wesleyan mission had been established at Wangaroa, which he 
visited and assisted, and finding Mr. Leigh, the chief minister, 
very ill, offered him a passage to Sydney for advice, but this 
ship had scarcely weighed anchor before a great storm came on; 
the ship was lost, and the crew and passengers had to land in 
boats, and return for two months longer before a ship could be 
found to bring them home, and in this time he did all in his 
power to bring the Maories to agree to some settled form of 
government under a single chief; but though any chief, especially
Hunghi, was quite willing to be that one, nobody would be 
anything secondary, and thus the project failed.&nbsp; He also 
set the missionaries the task of endeavouring to collect a fixed 
vocabulary and grammar, which might be available in future 
translations.&nbsp; The great kindness shown him at his shipwreck
had greatly touched his heart, especially in contrast with the 
usage he was meeting with in Australia, for this was in the 
height of the persecution about Ring, which detained him at home 
for more than two years.&nbsp; During this time Mr. Williams was 
joined by his brother William, also a priest of the English 
Church, but the wars of the Maories had become so desperate that 
the peril of the missionaries had been much increased; indeed, 
the Wesleyans had had the whole of their premises ravaged, so 
that the minister came as a fugitive to find a refuge at 
Paramatta, as a guest of Mr. Marsden.</p>
<p>That brave soldier of his Lord decided on going at once to the
scene of peril.&nbsp; Though sixty-three years old, he sailed as 
soon as possible in H.M.S. <i>Rainbow</i>, but found peace 
restored and the danger to his missions over.&nbsp; He therefore 
came back, after remaining only five days at his labours in New 
South Wales, to the superintendence of the translation of several
chapters of Holy Scripture, and to the instruction of the young 
Maories at the sort of college he had tried from the first to 
keep up at Paramatta, but which he was forced to abandon, since 
the <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>delicate lungs of the Maories could 
not endure the parching dryness of the Australian climate.</p>
<p>By the time he went again to New Zealand, in 1830, Hunghi had 
been killed in battle, and the nation was fast dwindling between 
war and a disease resembling the influenza.&nbsp; It was 
estimated that in twenty years the numbers had diminished by 
one-half, and in the meantime English settlers were entering on 
the lands so numerously that it was evident that before long the 
islands would be annexed to the British crown.&nbsp; Mr. Marsden 
had hoped at first that this brave and intelligent people might 
have been Christianized and civilized, so as to stand alone, but 
finding that their deadly feuds and internecine savagery rendered
this impossible, he thought it best to prepare them to come 
willingly under a curb that he trusted would be no more than 
beneficial.</p>
<p>He found the missionaries much alarmed, for a horrible battle 
had just been fought, caused by the misconduct and insulting 
behaviour of the crew of an English ship.&nbsp; One tribe had 
taken their part, another had risen to revenge the affront, and a
great mutual slaughter had taken place; victory had remained with
the avengers, and though the offending crew had sailed away, it 
was apprehended that all the English might suffer in their 
stead.&nbsp; There was not an hour to be lost.&nbsp; Mr. Marsden 
and Mr. Williams crossed the bay and entered the camp of the 
English allies, where they were affectionately greeted, and 
allowed to carry proposals of peace to the victorious party, but 
there they met with a less friendly reception, being told that 
they were answerable for the lives of those who had fallen in the
battle, since it had been occasioned by the misconduct of their 
countrymen.&nbsp; When Mr. Marsden promised to write to England 
to prevent the return of the offenders, the savages desired he 
would do no such thing, since they only desired vengeance.&nbsp; 
However, they agreed to hold a meeting with the hostile tribe, 
and endeavour to come to terms.&nbsp; Early the next morning 
thirty-six canoes arrived opposite to the mission station, some 
containing forty men; and notice was given that if the 
commissioners appointed on either side did not come to terms, the
white men would be the sacrifice.</p>
<p>The day was spent in conferences, but at night the chief of 
the hostile tribe clove a stick in two, in token that his anger 
was broken, and the two parties joined in a hideous war-dance, 
<!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
237</span>frequently firing their muskets; but peace was 
ratified, and Mr. Marsden found that real progress had been made 
among the natives around the stations.&nbsp; Many had become true
and sincere Christians, among them the widow and daughters of 
Hunghi.&nbsp; A Maori Christian woman was married by Mr. Marsden 
to an Englishman.&nbsp; She made all the responses in good 
English, and appeared in decent English clothes of her own 
sewing.&nbsp; He also married a young man, free, and of good 
family, to a girl who had been a slave taken in war, who was 
redeemed from her master for five blankets, an axe, and an iron 
pot.&nbsp; A number of natives lived round the missions, 
attending the services, and working with a good deal of industry 
and intelligence, and an increasingly large proportion of these 
were openly baptized Christians.</p>
<p>A seventh visit was paid by Mr. Marsden in 1837, when 
seventy-two years of age.&nbsp; On his return an officer in the 
ship observed: &ldquo;I think, sir, you may look on this as your 
last visit to New Zealand.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he 
answered, &ldquo;I intend to be off again in about six weeks; the
people in the colony are becoming too fine for me now.&nbsp; I am
too old to preach before them, but I can talk to the New 
Zealanders.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adhered to his purpose, and his 
daughter, Martha, who had been with him on his last voyage, 
accompanied him again in this.&nbsp; There had been some quarrels
with the crews of ships, but the natives always separated Mr. 
Marsden from the misdeeds of his people, and the old chiefs were 
delighted to see him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay with us and learn our 
language,&rdquo; one of them said: &ldquo;become our father and 
our friend, and we will build you a house.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied another, &ldquo;we cannot build a house
good enough, but we will hire Europeans to do it for 
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wherever he went, he was hailed as the friend of the Maori, 
and he made a progress through all the mission stations, which 
were growing up numerously, and whence Christianity was fast 
spreading by the agency of the Maories themselves.&nbsp; A chief 
named Koromona, made captive in Hunghi&rsquo;s great war, who had
become blind, had been converted by Mr. William Williams, and 
soon learnt the whole Liturgy, with many chapters of the Bible, 
and hymns, by heart, and was fit to be sent as a teacher among 
the other tribes.&nbsp; Sunday was generally observed, 
cannibalism and polygamy were retreating into the more remote and
heathenish regions, and there was every token that the noble <!--
page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
238</span>Apostle of New Zealand had verily conquered a country 
and people for the Church of God.&nbsp; Terrible wars among the 
tribes, provoking all the old ferocities, still were liable to 
arise, and the whaling crews, among whom might be found some of 
the most unscrupulous, licentious, and violent of mankind, 
continued to take advantage of there being no regular 
jurisdiction to commit outrages, which spread corruption or 
provoked retaliation, and for this there was no remedy but 
annexation to the British crown, which the influence of the 
mission was leading the natives themselves to desire, though this
was not carried out till after Mr. Marsden&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>This last visit took place in 1837.&nbsp; By that time the 
persecutions and troubles of Mr. Marsden&rsquo;s colonial life 
had been outlived,&mdash;though even as late as 1828, he writes 
about a pamphlet which actually charged him with inflicting 
torture to extract confession!&nbsp; But his character outweighed
all such absurd charges, and as a more respectable class of 
settlers flowed into the colony he was better appreciated.&nbsp; 
What the tone must have been may be guessed from the fact that 
when, in 1825, Governor Darling began regularly to attend church 
with his wife and family, it was regarded as an unexampled act in
the supreme magistrate!</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden lost his wife in 1835, but his daughter did her 
best to minister to his happiness, and was his companion and 
assistant in all he undertook.&nbsp; Once, when she was driving 
with him, two of the most terrible of the bushrangers, who were 
feared by the whole country, broke forth upon them, seized the 
horse, and holding a loaded pistol to Mr. Marsden&rsquo;s breast,
bade her empty his pockets into their hands, threatening to shoot
them both if either said a word.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the fearless
old man continued to remonstrate with them on their wicked life, 
telling them that he should see them again upon the gallows, and 
though they charged him with savage threats not to follow them 
with his eyes, he turned round and continued to warn them of the 
consequences of a life like theirs.&nbsp; In a few months&rsquo; 
time they were captured, and it did actually fall to his lot to 
attend them to the scaffold.</p>
<p>Yet, though of this fearless mould, he was one of the most 
loveable of men; everyone on his farm, as well as all little 
children, and the savages he conversed with, all loved him 
passionately.&nbsp; Some young Maories, whom he brought back on 
<!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
239</span>his last voyage, used to race after his gig to catch 
his eye, and when they took hold of any book, used to point 
upwards, as if whatever was associated with Matua, as they called
him, must lead to heaven.&nbsp; He was fond of playing with 
children, and never was so happy as when he yearly collected the 
schoolchildren of Paramatta on his lawn, for a feast and games 
after it.</p>
<p>In 1834, the Rev. William Grant Broughton, one of the clergy 
of Australia, took home an account of the spiritual destitution 
of New South Wales, and the effect was that in 1836 a bishopric 
was there created, and the first presentation given to him.&nbsp;
Some thought that this was a passing over of the chaplain who had
laboured so hard for so many years, but Mr. Marsden himself only 
observed that it was better thus: he was too old a man, and it 
was with sincere goodwill that he handed over the charge he had 
held for more than forty years, so that only the parish of 
Paramatta remained to him, and there he continued his ministry in
church, to the sick, and among the poor to the end.</p>
<p>On the last Sunday of his life he seemed in his usual health; 
but for the first time he did not take part in the service, and 
at the celebration he seemed to be so overcome by his feelings as
not to move from his place to communicate, when, after a pause, 
his son-in-law went to him with the sacred elements.&nbsp; There 
were many tears shed by those who foreboded that his hand would 
never administer to them again.&nbsp; On the Tuesday he set out 
for a short journey, but apparently he took a chill on the way to
the house of his friend, Mr. Styles, at Windsor, and arrived 
unwell; erysipelas in the head came on, with a stupor of the 
faculties, and he died on Saturday, the 12th of May, 
1838,&mdash;a man much tried, but resolute, staunch, and gallant,
and, in the end, blessedly successful.</p>
<p>Two years later, New Zealand, by the wish of the Maories 
themselves, was added to the British dominions, a bishopric was 
erected there, and, did not our bounds forbid us to speak of 
those who are still among us, we could tell much of the 
development, under Bishop Selwyn, of Samuel Marsden&rsquo;s work:
though, alas! there is a tale to tell that disgraces, not our 
Government, but our people,&mdash;a story of lust of land and of 
gain, and of pertinacious unfairness towards the Maori, which has
alienated a large number of that promising and noble people, led 
to their <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>relapse into the horrors from which 
they had been freed, overthrown their flourishing Church in 
favour of a horrid, bloodthirsty superstition, and will probably 
finish its work by the destruction of the gallant race that once 
asked our protection.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.&nbsp; JOHN WILLIAMS, THE MARTYR OF 
ERROMANGO.</h2>
<p>Of Welsh extraction, and respectable though humble parentage, 
the pioneer and martyr of Polynesia, John Williams, was born at 
Tottenham High Court, London, in the year 1796.&nbsp; His parents
were Nonconformists, and he was educated at a 
&ldquo;commercial&rdquo; school at Edmonton, where the teaching 
did not aim at much beyond writing and accounts, all that was 
supposed, at that time, to be needful for a young 
tradesman.&nbsp; The chief point remembered of his childhood was 
an aptitude and handiness which caused all little breakages to be
kept for John to repair,&mdash;a small quality, but one of no 
small importance in the life of a missionary, who often finds 
ready resource essential to safety and to influence.</p>
<p>His mother was a good and religious woman, whose one great 
purpose in choosing a situation was to place him in a family 
where he might be influenced for good; and she was fortunate in 
finding a furnishing ironmonger whose care of his apprentices 
exactly met her views.&nbsp; While serving his time, John 
Williams was observed to delight in the hard practical work of 
the forge far more than in the easier and more popular 
employments of the shop, and he was always eager to be sent out 
to execute repairs, a task that was rather despised by his 
companions.&nbsp; He was not regarded as a religious youth till 
he was about eighteen; he considered that a serious direction had
been given to his mind one Sunday evening, when his 
master&rsquo;s wife, finding him just about to enter a tea-garden
with some idle companions, persuaded him to come with her to 
chapel, where he heard an impressive sermon that gave a colour to
his life.</p>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>After this, distinct habits of piety were formed, 
Williams was admitted to full membership at the chapel called the
Tabernacle, and, together with others of the more earnest young 
men of the congregation, formed a society called &ldquo;The 
Youths&rsquo; Class,&rdquo; one of those associations which, 
under whatever form, have, in all ages of Christianity, been 
found a most powerful and salutary means of quickening, uniting, 
and strengthening the young by the sense of fellowship.&nbsp; The
lads met every Monday evening for discussion, and every 
eighteenth Monday was devoted to special prayer.&nbsp; The 
minister of the chapel did not naturally preside, but would often
look in, say a few words on the subject in hand, and thus keep 
watch that the debates were properly conducted.</p>
<p>It was through this pastor, Mr. Wilks, that John Williams 
first imbibed his interest in the missionary cause,&mdash;an 
interest that gradually grew upon him so much, that in his 
twentieth year he decided upon devoting himself to the 
task.&nbsp; Good Mr. Wilks freely gave the young ironmonger 
assistance in supplying the deficiencies of his education, and in
July 1816 he was presented to the directors of the London 
Missionary Society, and passed an examination, after which he was
accepted, before he was out of his apprenticeship.&nbsp; 
According to rule, so young and so insufficiently instructed a 
man would ordinarily have had some years of training before 
actually undertaking to labour among the heathen, but there was 
at the moment an urgent call for aid from various branches, and 
it was decided, by a special vote of the committee, to send him 
out as soon as possible to the South Sea Islands.&nbsp; His 
master willingly released him from the seven months that remained
of his term; nor had his time of apprenticeship been by any means
wasted, for the mechanical skill he had acquired was of great 
importance to his success as a civilizer.&nbsp; Marriage was 
always recommended to the missionaries of the Baptist Societies, 
and Williams&rsquo;s fate was no sooner decided than he chose 
Mary Channer, a constant attendant at the Tabernacle, and a woman
helpful, kind, and brave, as befitted a missionary&rsquo;s 
wife.</p>
<p>A great meeting was soon after held, as a sort of dedication 
of the new labourers, nine in number, who were thence to go 
forth,&mdash;five to South Africa, four to Polynesia.&nbsp; Among
the Africans was Robert Moffat, a name memorable, both on his own
account and as the father-in-law of Livingstone.&nbsp; An elderly
<!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
242</span>minister stood forth and questioned the young men in 
the face of the congregation on their faith, their opinions, 
their motives, and their intentions; and then a Bible was 
solemnly presented to each by an elder minister, John Angell 
James, of Birmingham, one of the most able and highly reputed 
Nonconformists then living; and another minister, Dr. Waugh, 
addressing himself to Williams, who was much the youngest of the 
nine, said, &ldquo;Go, my dear young brother, and if your tongue 
cleave to the roof of your mouth, let it be with telling poor 
sinners the love of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>; and 
if your arms drop from their shoulders, let it be with knocking 
at men&rsquo;s hearts to gain admittance for Him 
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impression never left John Williams, and the injunction 
was fulfilled to the utmost of his power.&nbsp; He was a man of 
strong and vigorous frame, well fitted to encounter the perils of
climate; and with much enterprise, hardihood, and 
ingenuity.&nbsp; That his mind was in some degree narrowed by 
want of education, perhaps mattered less in the peculiar field of
his labours, where he was seldom brought in contact with wide 
questions.&nbsp; He had the excellent quality of ready sympathy 
and adaptability to the persons around him, whether civilized or 
savage, and was so good-natured and yielding in unimportant 
matters, that the strength and firmness with which he would stand
up for whatever he viewed as a matter of conscience, always took 
his opponents by surprise; but it was always long before this 
point was reached, and he was perhaps too ready to give up when 
it was judgment rather than right and wrong that came into 
play.&nbsp; Williams&rsquo;s face, as given in the portrait 
attached to his &ldquo;History of Missionary Enterprise in the 
South Sea,&rdquo; curiously agrees with his history.&nbsp; There 
is much power about the brow, much enterprise in the strong, 
somewhat aquiline nose, great softness and sweetness in the eyes,
but the thickness of the lips and chin betray the want of 
cultivation; indeed, the curious manner in which the mouth is 
pursed up, would seem to indicate that an eager temper naturally 
kept it unclosed, and that the restraint of sitting for a picture
rendered the expression uncomfortably prim.</p>
<p>The Polynesian Mission on which John Williams was sent, had 
been commenced in 1796 by the London Missionary Society, partly 
in consequence of the death-bed entreaties of Selina, Countess of
Huntingdon, who had been exceedingly interested by the accounts 
of the South Sea Islands in Captain <!-- page 243--><a 
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
243</span>Cook&rsquo;s Voyages.&nbsp; The subscriptions amounted 
to 10,000<i>l.</i>, and were sufficient to purchase a ship called
the <i>Duff</i>, which was commanded by that Captain Wilson whose
wonderful history has been noticed in the lives of the Serampore 
body.&nbsp; Twenty-five missionaries were taken out, and received
at Tahiti with grotesque dances and caperings.&nbsp; The 
dwelling, which had been erected when Captain Bligh was 
collecting bread-fruit, was given to them, and several were 
placed there, while the <i>Duff</i> carried others to the 
Friendly and Marquesan Islands, and, after visiting them all a 
second time, returned home for reinforcements.</p>
<p>On the next voyage, however, with a different captain, the 
<i>Duff</i> was captured by a French privateer, the captain of 
which, when he understood the purpose of the voyage, greatly 
regretted what he had done, and declared that he would rather 
have given 500<i>l.</i> than have interfered with it.&nbsp; He 
landed the missionaries at Monte Video, and assisted them in 
obtaining a passage home, in the course of which they were again 
captured by a Portuguese, whose treatment of them was a wretched 
contrast to that of the friendly Frenchman.</p>
<p>Meantime, many disasters had befallen the unassisted 
missionaries, who suffered from the hostility of a section of the
natives, though the king, Pomare, always protected them.&nbsp; 
One of their number insisted on marrying a native woman still 
unconverted, separated from his brethren, and was soon after 
murdered by the natives.&nbsp; Another was lost in a still sadder
way.&nbsp; He reasoned himself into doubts of the Divine power 
and of the immortality of the soul, and finally left the island, 
nor was he heard of again for many years, though prayer was 
constantly made for him, and at length it became known that he 
had wandered to Serampore, where the influence of Marshman and 
Carey had prevailed to bring back his faith, but he had since 
been lost at sea.&nbsp; What wonderful glimpses we get of strange
wild lives!</p>
<p>But the Tahitian Mission had not included any one leading 
character, so that it may be enough to state that, after years of
patient effort and often of danger, the missionaries beheld King 
Pomare II., the successor of him whom they had found on the 
throne, solemnly burn his idols, and profess himself a 
Christian.</p>
<p>From that time the island has been Christian.&nbsp; The 
standard <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>of morality has been by no means as 
high as it ought to be, and there is much disappointment in 
dealing with any nation, with none more so than with an indolent 
and voluptuous people, in a climate disposing them to inertness, 
and in a part subject to the visits of lawless seamen of all 
nations.&nbsp; However, the mission kept its hold of Tahiti, 
until the French, in 1844, began a series of aggressions, which 
ended in their establishing a protectorate over the islands, 
introducing their Church, and doing all in their power to 
discourage the London Mission, to which, however, many of the 
natives still adhere.</p>
<p>This, however, is anticipating.&nbsp; When the five young men 
sailed in 1817, and after a kindly welcome on their way from Mr. 
Marsden at Sydney, things were in the full blush of 
promise.&nbsp; Eight hundred people worshipped at the chapel of 
Erineo, near the landing-place.&nbsp; It was a circular building,
a good deal like a haystack, with walls of stakes, a thatch of 
large leaves, and a desk in the centre of the floor for the 
preacher.&nbsp; This was his first station, and whilst there he 
gave his assistance in building a ship, to enable King Pomare to 
open a trade with New South Wales.&nbsp; He stayed in this place 
till he had become familiar with the language, and his first 
child was born there.</p>
<p>Not long after some allies of Pomare, from Huahime, struck 
with the benefits produced among the Tahitians by the 
missionaries, entreated that some might be sent to them likewise;
and Williams, his wife and child, with two other married pairs, 
and an interpreter, were told off for the mission.</p>
<p>They were welcomed eagerly, had oval huts assigned to them, 
and no lack of pork and yams, but Mr. Williams did not long 
remain there, being called away by an invitation from 
Raiatea.&nbsp; This is one of the loveliest of tropical islands, 
the largest of the Society Islands.&nbsp; Huge mountain masses 
rise from the centre of an isle, about fifty miles in 
circumference, and give it the grandeur of the rock, the 
precipice, and the waterfall; but all around and below, the sides
are clothed with the exquisite verdure of the southern clime, the
palm, the bread-fruit, the yam, and all that can delight the eye;
and both this and a little satellite islet are fenced in by an 
encircling coral reef, within which is clear still deep water, 
fit for navies to ride in, and approachable through numerous 
inlets in its natural breakwater.&nbsp; It was a spot of much 
distinction, containing the temple of the god Oro, who was 
revered by all the <!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>surrounding groups, as the god of 
war, to whom children were dedicated to make them 
courageous.&nbsp; There dreadful human sacrifices were offered, 
concluded by cannibal feasts.&nbsp; Whenever such a sacrifice was
required, the priest and king despatched messengers to the chiefs
of the districts around to inquire whether they had a broken 
calabash, or a rotten cocoa-nut.&nbsp; These terms indicated a 
man whom they would be willing to give up.&nbsp; The victim was 
then either knocked down with a blow of a small stone at the back
of his head, or else speared in his own house; and when one man 
of a family had thus been sacrificed, all the rest had the same 
horrid preference.</p>
<p>The last human victim of Tahiti was verily a martyr.&nbsp; He 
was designated because he had begun to pray.&nbsp; The emissaries
came to his house and asked his wife where he was.&nbsp; Then, 
borrowing from her the ironwood stick used for breaking open 
cocoa-nuts, they went after him, and knocked him down with it, 
binding him hand and foot, and placing him in a long basket made 
of cocoa-nut leaves.&nbsp; His wife rushed forward, but was kept 
away, as the touch or breath of a woman is considered to pollute 
a sacrifice.&nbsp; The man, however, recovered the blow, and 
spoke out boldly: &ldquo;Friends, I know what you intend to do 
with me.&nbsp; You are about to kill me, and offer me up as a 
<i>tab&aelig;</i> to your savage gods.&nbsp; I know it is vain 
for me to beg for mercy, for you will not spare my life.&nbsp; 
You may kill my body, but you cannot hurt my soul, for I have 
begun to pray to <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this, his bearers set him on the ground, put one 
stone under his head, and beat out his brains with another, and 
thus died the last Tahitian sacrifice, truly baptized in his own 
blood.&nbsp; The other gods besides Oro were numerous, and there 
were also many animals supposed to be possessed with familiar 
spirits.&nbsp; A chief was once in the cabin of a ship where 
there was a talking cockatoo: the moment the bird spoke he rushed
away in the utmost terror, leapt overboard, and swam for his 
life, convinced that he had heard the captain&rsquo;s demon.</p>
<p>The chief of Raiatea was named Tamatoa, and was a man of 
considerable power.&nbsp; Two years previously the Tahitian king,
Pomare, nineteen of his subjects, and a missionary named Wilson 
had been driven thither in a canoe by stress of weather; and what
Tamatoa had heard from them had so impressed him that he had 
persuaded his people to build a place of worship, <!-- page 
246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
246</span>observe the Sunday, and meet to repeat together the 
scant lessons they had been able to receive during the visit of 
the Tahitians.&nbsp; This led to a resolve to entreat for the 
presence of a missionary among them; and the chieftain himself 
came to Huahime to make the request.&nbsp; Williams longed to go,
but, as the youngest minister, waited till all the rest had 
decided to the contrary, and then gladly accepted his lot to go 
with Tamatoa.&nbsp; There was a joyous welcome, and a feast was 
brought, consisting of five pigs for Mr. Williams, five for his 
wife, and five for their baby-boy; besides crates of yams, 
bananas, and cocoa-nuts, which, however, they were not required 
to eat themselves, only to see eaten in their house.</p>
<p>The islanders were ready to give up their idols and call 
themselves Christians, to hear Mr. Williams preach, and to 
observe the Sabbath; being, in fact, like the Red Indians of 
Eliot&rsquo;s experience, so idle that a day of no work made no 
difference to them.&nbsp; Their indolence, the effect of their 
enervating climate, was well-nigh invincible; they preferred 
hunger to trouble, and withal their customs were abhorrent to 
Christian morality.&nbsp; Most islets of the South Seas have much
the same experience.&nbsp; The people, taken on their best side, 
show themselves gentle and intelligent, and their chiefs are 
dignified gentlemen; but there is a horrible background of 
ferocity and barbarism&mdash;often cannibalism.&nbsp; It 
generally proves comparatively easy to obtain a recognition of 
Christianity, and the cruelty and violence are usually laid 
aside; but to bring purity and morality to bear upon these races 
is a much more difficult thing, and the apparent failures have 
been at once the grief and reproach of missionaries, while those 
who assail them with scoffs forget the difficulty of dealing with
the inveterate customs of a whole people, in a luxurious climate,
and with little or no inducement to such industrial occupations 
or refinements of mind, as are the best auxiliaries of religion 
in raising the tone.</p>
<p>Lands where cold is unknown, and where fruit grows as freely 
as in Paradise, offer no inducement to labour; and the 
missionaries, striving in vain to lead the people to think 
occupation a duty, were deserted as being troublesome when they 
bade them to work.&nbsp; A school which the Williams&rsquo;s set 
up was more popular; the Polynesians had no lack of brains, and 
reading and writing were pleasanter than digging and building, or
carrying logs.</p>
<p><!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>Thinking that examples of the civilization that the 
islanders had never seen would do more for their advance than 
anything else, Mr. Williams, with such assistance as he could 
obtain from the natives, built himself a house with eight rooms, 
sash windows with Venetian blinds, a verandah, and a most 
beautiful garden, and filled it with polished furniture, made by 
his own clever mechanical hands.&nbsp; With the assistance of one
or two other missionaries who joined him, he succeeded in thus 
exciting a certain emulation among the natives.&nbsp; The king 
had a house built for him like that of the white men, others 
followed, and thus a very important step was made out of the 
degraded customs encouraged by the old oval huts.&nbsp; The 
coral, made into lime, afforded excellent material for plaster, 
and trades began to be fostered among the natives; they became 
carpenters, blacksmiths, plasterers, boat-builders, and acquired 
some ideas of agriculture.&nbsp; By the end of the second year, 
the chapel and school stood in the midst of white cottages; the 
population still wore clothing made of their own bark cloth, but 
in imitation of that of their teachers, and the open savagery of 
the island was gone.&nbsp; The congregation assembled three times
on Sunday, and there was family prayer in almost every 
house.&nbsp; Cannibalism was ended, and so was infanticide, one 
of the most terrible customs of the island, for there was 
scarcely a woman above thirty who had not put to death several of
her infants.&nbsp; Much had been done, although the good man to 
whom so much was owing did not feel satisfied that the profession
in many cases was thoroughly deep, and he still knew of many an 
inveterate evil, that only time, discipline, and above all 
heartfelt religion, could uproot.</p>
<p>A large chapel, built with all the taste and ornament that he 
could achieve, was erected, the sides wattled, the roof supported
by pillars of tree-trunks, and the floors and pews, the pulpit 
and desk, which were all to which the young ironmonger at the 
Tabernacle attached the notion of a worthy place of worship, were
solid and well finished.&nbsp; He even fashioned some chandeliers
for evening service, and these so astonished the Raiateans, that 
on first entering the chapel, they broke out into a cry of amaze,
&ldquo;Oh, Britannia!&nbsp; Britannia!&rdquo; and gave the name 
to England of &ldquo;the land whose customs were without 
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opening of this chapel was one great step in Mr. 
Williams&rsquo;s <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>work; the next was the inducing 
Tamatoa and the other chiefs to bind themselves to govern by a 
code of Christian laws, not complex, but based on the Ten 
Commandments, and agreeing with those newly established by Pomare
in Tahiti, but with this difference, that Williams ventured to 
introduce trial by jury, in the hope that it would tend to 
qualify the despotic power of the chiefs.&nbsp; Tamatoa&rsquo;s 
brother, Pahi, was appointed judge, and the community was 
arranged on a Christian basis.&nbsp; The congregation was 
likewise put under regular discipline after the example of the 
Independents in England, with ruling pastors and elders appointed
from among the people; and an auxiliary Missionary Society was 
formed for assisting in the conversion of the other isles.</p>
<p>Just as this was thoroughly arranged, in about the fourth year
of his mission, Williams suffered from a malady which seemed to 
him and his companion, Mr. Threlkeld, to necessitate his return 
home.&nbsp; The information was received by the islanders with 
something like despair.&nbsp; Old King Tamatoa came to him and 
said, &ldquo;Viriamu, I have been thinking you are a strange 
man.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> did not take care of 
His body.&nbsp; He did not even shrink from death, and now you 
are afflicted you are going to leave us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prayer was offered all over the island, and in the midst of 
all the preparations for departure the disease began to 
ameliorate, and Mr. Williams recovered for a time, though the 
next year a recurrence of the attack made him resolve upon a 
visit to Sydney, not only for the sake of advice, but in the hope
of establishing a market for the produce of the Society Isles, 
which might give a motive to the industry he was so anxious to 
promote, and likewise to obtain a vessel to be used for the 
missions.</p>
<p>Two Raiatean teachers instructed by him were landed at the 
island of Aitutake on the way, after the chiefs had pledged 
themselves to support and protect them, and the voyage was 
continued to Australia, where there was as usual a warm reception
from Mr. Marsden.&nbsp; It was a very important visit.&nbsp; 
Parts of the Holy Scriptures, catechisms, and spelling-books, 
were printed; the ship, with the assistance of the Society of 
which Marsden was agent, was purchased, a schooner of ninety 
tons, and named <i>Te Matama</i>, the Beginner; a person named 
Scott secured, at 150<i>l.</i> per annum, to instruct the natives
in the cultivation of sugar <!-- page 249--><a 
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>and 
tobacco, and stores laid in of presents for the natives, clothes 
for the women, shoes, stockings, tea-kettles, tea-cups, saucers, 
and tea.&nbsp; The natives had a great liking for tea, and as 
they could not cherish cups and saucers without shelves to put 
them on, all this was an indirect mode of introducing European 
comforts and decencies.&nbsp; As to shoes, there can be no spade 
husbandry with an unshod foot, and thus the system of 
hoeing-women doing all the labour was attacked.</p>
<p>On the way back to Raiatea, Mr. Williams visited New Zealand, 
but not at a favourable moment, for the chiefs were at war, and 
he had to hurry away.&nbsp; The cargo was gladly welcomed at 
Raiatea, and the desire to purchase European dress was found a 
great incentive to industry.</p>
<p>In 1823, Mr. Williams began a series of missionary 
voyages.&nbsp; The events of these have almost too much sameness 
for description, though full of interest in detail.&nbsp; The 
people, when taken on their right side, were almost always ready 
to admit teachers, and adopt certain externals, though the true 
essentials of Christianity were of much slower growth.&nbsp; Our 
limits prevent us from giving much of detail of his intercourse 
with these isles.&nbsp; Raiatea was his first home, Rarotonga his
second.&nbsp; There he placed his family, which long consisted of
his one boy, John, born in Tahiti, all Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s 
subsequent babes scarcely living to see the light, until, in the 
sixteenth year of her Polynesian life, another son rejoiced 
her.&nbsp; She became a centre and pattern of domestic life, and 
instructed the women in feminine habits, and she patiently 
encountered the anxieties and perils, chiefly from storm and 
hurricane, that beset her life.&nbsp; The chief troubles that Mr.
Williams encountered at Raiatea, were the vices that civilization
brought.&nbsp; After old Tamatoa&rsquo;s death, his son allowed a
distillery to be established, and drunkenness threatened to 
overthrow the habits so diligently taught.&nbsp; May be, the 
Puritanical form of religion and the acquired tastes of the 
London tradesman did not allow brightness and beauty enough to 
these children of the South, and tempted them by proscribing 
things innocent, but there is no telling: nothing but strictness 
seemed a sufficient protection from the foul rites of idolatry, 
and all that his judgment or devotion could devise for these 
people Williams and his fellows did.</p>
<p>The Samoan group of islands was one of those where the people 
showed the most intelligence.&nbsp; They were already great <!-- 
page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
250</span>cultivators of the toilette.&nbsp; A Samoan beau 
glistened from the head to the hips with sweet-scented oil, and 
was tastefully tattooed from the hips to the knees; he wore a 
bandage of red leaves oiled and shining, a head-dress formed of a
pearly disk of nautilus-shell, and a string of small white shells
round each arm.&nbsp; His lady was not tattooed, but spotted all 
over, and when in full attire, wore a beautiful white silky mat 
at her waist, a wreath of sweet flowers round her head, rows of 
large blue beads round her neck, and the upper part of her person
was tinged with turmeric rouge.</p>
<p>These Samoans, though they deified many animals, had no 
temples, idols, priests, nor sacrifices, and thus were more than 
usually amenable to Christian ideas; and on Mr. Williams&rsquo;s 
second visit to the island, he had a numerous congregation, but 
so arranged that he could hardly keep his countenance.&nbsp; Some
had their long hair greased and stiffened into separate locks, 
standing erect like quills upon the fretful porcupine; while 
others wore it cultivated into one huge bush, stiffened with 
coral line, diversified with turmeric.&nbsp; Indeed, there is no 
rest for such heads as these&mdash;none of their wearers dares to
sleep without a little stool to support his neck, so as not to 
crush his <i>chevelure</i> against the ground.</p>
<p>These fine gentlemen had a readiness and intelligence about 
them that warmed to the first rays of light.&nbsp; They listened 
eagerly, and their attachment to the missionary was expressed in 
a song sung in what they called a &ldquo;heavenly dance&rdquo; of
the ladies in his honour, when he had remained with them long 
enough to plant the good seed of a growing church.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let us talk of 
Viriamu,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let cocoa-nuts glow in peace for months;<br />
When strong the east winds blow, our hearts forget him not.<br />
Let us greatly love the Christian land of the great white 
chief.<br />
All victors are we now, for we all have one God.<br />
No food is sacred now.&nbsp; All kinds of fish we catch and 
eat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the sting-ray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds are crying for Viriamu,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His ship has sailed another 
way.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds are crying for Viriamu,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long time is he in coming.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will he ever 
come again?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will he ever 
come again?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was some time before he could come again; for, after <!-- 
page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
251</span>eighteen years of unremitting labour in the isles of 
Raiatea and Rarotonga, and of voyages touching on many other 
isles, he had made up his mind to visit England.</p>
<p>He came home in 1834, and remained about four years, doing 
much for his cause by his personal narratives and vivid accounts 
of the people to whom he had devoted his life.&nbsp; Curiously 
enough, his son, now a youth of twenty, was introduced to Earl 
Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s gardener, who proved to have been one of the 
mission party who had been captured in the <i>Duff</i> on the 
second voyage, and who was delighted to hear of the wonderful 
progress of the cause from which he himself had been turned 
back.</p>
<p>A subscription was raised for the purchase of a mission ship, 
exceeding in size and suitability such craft as could be 
purchased or hired in Australia; and the <i>Camden</i>, a vessel 
admirably fitted for the purpose, was obtained and equipped at a 
cost of 2,600<i>l.</i>, the command of her given to Captain 
Morgan, who was well experienced in the navigation of the 
Polynesian seas, and had, moreover, such a reputation for piety, 
that the natives termed his vessel &ldquo;the praying 
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this vessel a large reinforcement of missionaries was taken
out, including a married pair for Samoa, and likewise young John 
Williams, who had found himself an English wife; but his little 
brother was left at home for education.&nbsp; The intention of 
Williams was to station the missionaries upon the friendly isles,
and himself circulate among them in the <i>Camden</i>, breaking 
fresh ground in yet unvisited isles, and stationing first native 
and then English teachers, as they were prepared for them.</p>
<p>Among the Samoans he remained a good while.&nbsp; He estimated
the population at 60,000, of whom nearly 50,000 were under 
instruction.&nbsp; Several places of worship were opened with 
feasts, at which huge hecatombs of swine were 
consumed&mdash;1,370 at one festival.&nbsp; One young chief under
instruction became so good a preacher, that Williams called him 
the Whitfield of Samoa; and these islands have, under the 
training then set on foot, furnished many a missionary and even 
martyr to the isles around, and are, to the present day, one of 
the happiest specimens of the effects of missionary labour.</p>
<p>The want of extended views in good Mr. Williams was shown in 
his manner of regarding the expected arrival of some Roman 
Catholic priests in the Polynesian seas.&nbsp; He set to <!-- 
page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
252</span>work to translate Foxe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of 
Martyrs,&rdquo; and begged that a present offered him for his 
people might be expended in slides illustrating it for a 
beautiful magic lantern which he already possessed, and whose 
Scripture scenes drew tears from the natives.&nbsp; He had not 
Church knowledge enough to rise above the ordinary popular view 
of &ldquo;Popery,&rdquo; and did not understand its Christianity 
enough to see the evils of sowing the bitterest seeds of the 
Protestant controversy among scarcely reclaimed heathens.</p>
<p>On their side, the Roman Catholics would have done better to 
enter on untrodden ground, of which there was such an infinity, 
than to force themselves where, if they did not find their 
Church, at least they found faith in the Saviour.&nbsp; But the 
Society Isles were coveted, for political reasons, by the 
existing French Government, and the struggle was there beginning,
of which Mr. Williams was not destined to see the unfortunate 
conclusion.</p>
<p>Raiatea he found much improving; and at Rarotonga civilization
had made such progress, that the chiefs house was two storeys 
high, with ten bedrooms, and good furniture made in imitation of 
English, and any linen Mr. Williams left in his room was 
immediately washed, ironed, and laid ready for use.&nbsp; Much of
the lurking heathenism was giving way, and fair progress being 
made in religious feeling, when, after a stay in Samoa, where 
Mrs. Williams now chiefly resided, John Williams set out on an 
exploring voyage in the <i>Camden</i>.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, his last text in preaching to the Samoans 
was, &ldquo;Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, 
that they should see his face no more;&rdquo; and the people, who
always grieved whenever he left them, wept as bitterly at the 
words as if they had known them to be an omen.&nbsp; He was bent 
on an attempt on the heathen isle of Erromango, which his wife 
viewed with a foreboding terror, that made her in vain try to 
extract a promise from him not to land there.</p>
<p>But he viewed the New Hebrides as an important link, leading 
perhaps to reaching the Papuan race in New Guinea.&nbsp; He hoped
to gain a footing there, and make the spot such a centre as 
Tahiti, Raiatea, Rarotonga, and Samoa had successively been; and,
as the <i>Camden</i> glided along the shores of the island, he 
talked of his schemes, and of a certain sense of fear that they 
gave him, lest they were too vast to be accomplished <!-- page 
253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>by
his means and in his lifetime, but with the sanguine buoyancy of 
a man still in full vigour, and who had met with almost unmixed 
success.</p>
<p>On the 20th of November, 1839, the vessel entered 
Dillon&rsquo;s Bay, and a canoe with three men paddled up to 
her.&nbsp; A boat was lowered, in which Mr. Williams, two other 
missionaries named Harris and Cunningham, Captain Morgan, and 
four sailors seated themselves.&nbsp; They tried to converse with
the natives, but the language proved to be unlike any in use in 
Polynesia (it is, in fact, one of the Melanesian dialects), and 
not a word could be made out.</p>
<p>Pulling into a creek, some beads and a small looking-glass 
were thrown to the natives, and water asked for by signs.&nbsp; 
It was brought, and this gave more confidence.&nbsp; Harris then 
waded ashore.&nbsp; At first the people ran away, but Mr. 
Williams called to him to sit down, and, on his doing so, they 
came nearer, and offered him some cocoa-nut milk.&nbsp; Mr. 
Williams observed little boys at play, and thought it a good 
sign.&nbsp; Captain Morgan wished they had been women, because 
the natives always send their wives out of the way when they mean
violence.&nbsp; However, Williams landed, and divided some cloth 
among those who stood nearest.&nbsp; Then Harris began to walk 
forward into the bush, Williams following, and, with a crowd of 
natives round him, was counting in Samoan, trying whether the 
boys around would recognize the names of the figures.&nbsp; 
Cunningham did not like the countenances of the natives, and 
remarked it to him, but was not heard.&nbsp; Stooping to pick up 
a shell, Cunningham was startled by a yell, and Harris came 
rushing along, pursued by a native.&nbsp; Williams turned and 
looked, a blast on a shell was heard, and he too fled.&nbsp; 
Cunningham reached the boat in safety, but Harris fell in 
crossing a small brook, and the natives were at once upon him 
with their clubs.&nbsp; Williams had made for the sea, apparently
intending to swim off and let the boat pick him up, but the beach
was stony; he fell as he reached the water, and the natives with 
their clubs and arrows had fallen upon him before Morgan could 
turn his boat&rsquo;s head to the spot, under a shower of arrows,
which forced him to put off.</p>
<p>He saw the body lying on the beach, and fired a gun, loaded 
with powder, in hopes of driving away the natives and rescuing 
it; but they dragged it away into the bush, and all that was left
<!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
254</span>for him to do was to sail for Sydney, whence a 
Queen&rsquo;s ship, the <i>Favourite</i>, was despatched to 
endeavour to recover the remains, and to convey the tidings to 
Samoa.</p>
<p>By the 26th of February the vessel arrived.&nbsp; The 
war-conch was heard, and the savages were seen flying in all 
directions; but, as there was no intention of exacting a revenge,
means of communication were at last arranged, and it was 
discovered that these two good men had furnished a cannibal 
feast, but that their skulls and many of their bones had been 
preserved, and these were recovered and carried on board 
ship.&nbsp; The Erromangans have always been an exceptionally 
treacherous and savage race, and, even to the present day, are 
more hostile to white men, and more addicted to cannibalism, than
any of the other islanders.</p>
<p>The <i>Favourite</i> then proceeded to Samoa, where the 
weeping and wailing of the tender-hearted race was 
overwhelming.&nbsp; Mrs. Williams, in her silent English sorrow, 
was made the centre of a multitude of frantic mourners.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Aue kriamu, aue Viriamu, our father, our father!&nbsp; He 
has turned his face from us!&nbsp; We shall never see him 
more!&nbsp; He that brought us the good word of salvation is 
gone!&nbsp; Oh, cruel heathen, they knew not what they did.&nbsp;
How great a man they have destroyed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such laments went on round the widow in the wild poetic 
language of the poor Samoans, till the other teachers, by their 
prayers and sermons, had produced a somewhat calmer tone; and the
funeral took place beside the chapel, attended by the officers 
and crew of the <i>Favourite</i>, and a great concourse of 
natives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Viriamu!&rdquo; was the cry in every Christian 
Polynesian island for many a day; and well it might be, for, in 
spite of the shortcomings of a poorly-educated ministry and a 
tropical and feeble race, there are few who ever turned more men 
from darkness to light, from cannibal fury to Christian love, 
than the Martyr of Erromango,&mdash;John Williams,&mdash;one of 
the happiest of missionaries, in that to him was given the 
martyr&rsquo;s crown, in the full tide of his success and 
hope.</p>
<h2><!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>CHAPTER X.&nbsp; ALLEN GARDINER, THE
SAILOR MARTYR.</h2>
<p>The biography we next have to turn to is not that of a 
founder, scarcely that of a pioneer, but rather of a brave 
guerilla, whose efforts were little availing because wanting in 
combination, and undirected, but who, nevertheless, has left 
behind him a heart-thrilling name won by unflinching 
self-devotion even unto death.</p>
<p>Allen Francis Gardiner, the fifth son of a Berkshire squire, 
was born in 1794.&nbsp; He was a born sailor, and became a 
midshipman before the end of the great war of the French 
revolution; but the only naval action in which he was engaged was
against the American vessel <i>Essex</i>, which was captured by 
his ship, the <i>Ph&oelig;be</i>, off Valparaiso.&nbsp; Allen 
Gardiner had been carefully brought up by a good mother, but her 
death in his early youth cast him loose and left him without any 
influence to keep up serious impressions.&nbsp; He drifted into 
carelessness and godlessness, though at times some old 
remembrance, roused by danger or by a comrade&rsquo;s death, 
would sting him sharply.&nbsp; Once, feeling ashamed of having 
forgotten the very words of Scripture, he made up his mind to buy
a Bible, and then was so full of false shame that he waited about
in the street till the shop should be empty, and then only 
thought how odd his demand must seem to the bookseller.</p>
<p>Most likely this was at Portsmouth, for he had there met a 
lady who had been with his mother at her death, and had given him
a narrative of her last days, which his father had written, but 
from some sense of want of sympathy had withheld from the 
son.&nbsp; The friend judged him better.&nbsp; The copy in his 
own handwriting bears the date, &ldquo;Portsmouth, November 18, 
1818,&rdquo; and therewith was a little Bible with the same date 
written in it.&nbsp; For two years, however, this produced no 
effect; but in 1820, when at Penang, as a lieutenant in the 
<i>Dauntless</i>, Allen received a letter of grave reproof from 
his father, and one of warm kindness and expostulation from the 
same lady, his mother&rsquo;s friend, together with some 
books.&nbsp; Nothing would have seemed <!-- page 256--><a 
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>more 
hopeless than the chance that a letter from a religious old lady 
would make an impression on a dashing young naval officer, and 
yet Allen Gardiner always considered this as the turning-point of
his life, and connected it with his mother&rsquo;s prayers.</p>
<p>It was when his thoughts were directed to religious subjects, 
and his intelligence freshly excited, that he visited the coasts 
of South America, the region above all others where the Roman 
Catholic Church is seen to the most disadvantage.&nbsp; Two 
things most especially struck him, the remnants of the 
Inquisition at Lima, and the discovery that the poor were buried 
without prayer or mass.&nbsp; Such scenes as these gave him an 
extreme horror of Romanism and all that he supposed to be 
connected therewith, and his next station at Tahiti, in all the 
freshness of the newly established mission, full of devout 
people, filled him with strong enthusiasm for the good men who 
were carrying out the work.&nbsp; Shortly after he was invalided 
home, and as soon as he was fit for employment he offered himself
to the London Missionary Society, begging them to send him to the
neglected Indians of South America; but this did not suit their 
plans, and his ardour was slackened by the more common affairs of
life.&nbsp; He fell in love and married a young lady named Julia 
Reade, and his only voyage was in his naval, not his missionary 
capacity.&nbsp; But his wife&rsquo;s health was exceedingly 
frail, and after eleven years of marriage she died, leaving four 
children, a fifth having preceded her to the grave.&nbsp; Beside 
her death-bed Allen Gardiner made a solemn dedication of himself 
to act as a pioneer in one or other of the most neglected parts 
of the earth, not so much to establish missions himself as to 
reconnoitre the ground and prepare the way for their 
establishment.</p>
<p>Africa was the country to which his attention was first 
called.&nbsp; His wife died in May 1834, and the 24th of August 
was the last Sunday he spent in England, at Calbourne, the native
parish of Charles Simeon.&nbsp; He sailed at once for Cape 
Colony, where the English, who had in the course of the 
Revolutionary war obtained possession of the ground from the 
original settlers, the Dutch, were making progress in every 
direction, and coming into collision, not with the spiritless 
Hottentots of the Cape of Good Hope itself, but with that far 
more spirited and intellectual race, the 
Kaffirs&mdash;unbelievers, as the name meant&mdash;they being in 
fact of Arab descent, though Africanized by <!-- page 257--><a 
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>their 
transition through tropical latitudes, and not Mahometans.&nbsp; 
Such traditional religion as they possessed seemed to be 
vanishing, since only a few of the elders retained a curious 
legend of a supreme Deity who sent another Divine being to 
&ldquo;publish the news,&rdquo; and divide the sexes.&nbsp; A 
message was sent to him from the Power in heaven to announce that
man should not die, but this was committed to that tardy reptile 
the chameleon; then another message that man should die was given
to the lizard, who outran the chameleon, and thus brought death 
into the world.</p>
<p>Sir Benjamin D&rsquo;Urban had just been appointed Governor, 
and it was apprehended that a war must take place, since the 
settlers were continually liable to sudden attacks by these wild 
Kaffirs, who burnt, slew, and robbed any homestead they fell 
upon.&nbsp; Captain Gardiner thought, and justly, that it would 
be better to begin by proclaiming the glad tidings of peace to 
these wild and ignorant people rather than to meet them with the 
strong hand of war.&nbsp; The colony was lamentably deficient in 
clergy, and the missions that existed were chiefly to the 
Hottentots and Bushmen.&nbsp; The Moravians, whose work we have 
not mentioned because it is a history in itself, had some 
excellent establishments, but no one had yet attempted to 
penetrate into the home of the Kaffirs themselves, the Zulu 
country, to endeavour to deal with their chieftains.&nbsp; This 
was Allen Gardiner&rsquo;s intention, and on his outward voyage 
he met with a Polish refugee named Berken, who had intended to 
settle in Australia, but was induced to become his companion in 
his explorations in South Africa.</p>
<p>They rode together from Capetown to Grahamstown, where they 
obtained an interpreter named George Cyrus, and began to travel 
in the regular South African fashion, namely, with waggons fitted
for sleeping in, and drawn by huge teams of oxen, and taking 
seven horses with them.&nbsp; Their first adventure during a halt
at the Buffalo river was the loss of all their oxen, who were 
driven off by some natives.&nbsp; They applied to the chief of 
the tribe, named Tzatzoe, who recovered the cattle for them, but 
showed himself an insatiable beggar, even asking why, as Mr. 
Berken had two shoes, he could not spare him one of them.&nbsp; 
However, he was honest enough, when Mr. Berken chanced to leave 
his umbrella behind him, to send after him to ask whether he knew
that he had left his <i>house</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>The next anxiety was at a spot called the Yellow-wood 
River, where the mid-day halt was disturbed by an assembly of 
natives with a hostile appearance.&nbsp; Captain Gardiner sent 
orders to collect the oxen, and in-span (<i>i.e.</i> harness) 
them as soon as possible, but without appearance of alarm, and in
the meantime he tried to keep the natives occupied.&nbsp; To one 
he lent his penknife, and after the man had vainly tried to cut 
off his own beard with it, he offered to shave him, lathered him 
well, and performed the operation like a true barber, then showed
him his face in a glass.&nbsp; His only disappointment was that 
the moustache had not been removed, and as by this time the razor
was past work, Captain Gardiner had to pacify him by assuring him
that such was the appearance of many English warriors (for these 
were the days when moustaches were confined to the 
cavalry).&nbsp; The amusement this excited occupied them nearly 
long enough, but hostile murmurs then began to be 
heard&mdash;&ldquo;One of our chiefs has been killed by the white
men, no more shall enter our country!&rdquo;&nbsp; Fearing that 
an angry word would be fatal, Captain Gardiner asked for a 
war-song, promising some tobacco at the conclusion.&nbsp; 
Accordingly they danced madly, and shouted at the top of their 
voices,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No white man shall drink our milk,<br />
No white man shall eat our children&rsquo;s bread.<br />
Ho-how! ho-how! ho-how!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this couplet often repeated seemed to work off their rage;
they accepted the tobacco, and sullenly said the travellers might
pass, but they were the last who should.&nbsp; This was in the 
Amakosa country, lying between the Grahamstown settlement and 
Port Natal, and to the present day unannexed, though even then 
there were traders&rsquo; stations at intervals, so filthy and 
wretched as to be little above the huts of the natives.&nbsp; 
These Amakosa tribes were such thieves that great vigilance was 
needed to prevent property being stolen; but the next tribes, the
Amapondas, were scrupulously honest and friendly to the 
English.&nbsp; Their chief was found by Gardiner and Berken 
dressed in a leopard&rsquo;s skin, sitting in state under a 
canopy of shields, trying a rain-maker, who had failed to bring 
showers in consequence of not having his dues of cattle delivered
to him!&nbsp; The chief advised them not to proceed, as he said 
the Zulus were angry people who would kill them; but they pushed 
on, <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>though finding that the journey 
occupied much longer than they expected, so that provisions 
became a difficulty.</p>
<p>A full month had passed since leaving Grahamstown, and 
Gardiner decided on pressing on upon horseback, leaving Mr. 
Berken to bring up the waggons, and taking with him the 
interpreter and two natives.&nbsp; The distance was 180 miles, 
and a terrible journey it was.&nbsp; A few waggon tracks had made
a sort of road, but this was not always to be distinguished from 
hippopotamus paths, which led into horrible morasses, where the 
horses almost entirely disappeared, and had to be scooped out as 
it were by the hands; moreover, scarcely any food was to be 
had.&nbsp; In crossing one river one of the horses was so 
irretrievably stuck in a quicksand that humanity required it to 
be shot, and at the next, the Umkamas, the stream was so swollen 
that the Captain had to devise a canoe by sewing two cowskins 
together with sinews and stretching it upon branches, in which, 
as no one save himself had any notion of boating, he shoved off 
alone.&nbsp; The stream was too strong for him, and he had to 
return and obtain the help of the only good swimmer among his 
party.&nbsp; With him he crossed, but with no food save a 
canister of sugar!&nbsp; However, the native swam back and 
fetched a loaf of bread, while Captain Gardiner waited among the 
reeds, hearing the snorting and grunting of hippopotami all 
round.&nbsp; The transit of the natives was secured by the 
holding a sort of float made of a bundle of reeds, and in the 
morning, as the river was too high for the rest of the party to 
cross, he brought over a few necessaries, and a horse, with which
the Captain was able to proceed to Port Natal, where he found 
English traders, and sent back supplies to those in the rear.</p>
<p>The Zulus, on whom his attention was fixed, inhabit a fine 
country to the north of the Tugela, which is considered as the 
boundary of the British territory.&nbsp; The nation is full of 
intelligence and spirit, and by no means incapable of 
improvement, and their princes have been for generations past men
of considerable natural ability, and of iron will, but often 
savagely cruel.&nbsp; The first known to Englishmen was named 
Charka, a great warrior, who kept his armies in a rude but 
thorough discipline, and had made considerable conquests.&nbsp; 
About the year 1829, Charka had been murdered by his brother 
Dingarn, who had reigned ever since, and was the terror of the 
English settlers, who were beginning to immigrate into the 
fertile terraced <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>country of Natal.&nbsp; His forays 
might at any time sweep away farms and homesteads; and his 
subjects were continually fleeing from his violence across the 
Tugela, and thus might bring him down as a pursuer.</p>
<p>Allen Gardiner&rsquo;s plan was to go to the fountain head and
endeavour to deal with the chief himself, so as to make him a 
Christian instead of an enemy.&nbsp; With this end he set out 
absolutely unaccompanied, except by Cyrus the interpreter, and a 
Zulu servant whom he had hired named Umpondombeni, and this with 
the knowledge that an English officer had shortly before been 
treacherously murdered, and that Dingarn was a blood-stained 
savage.</p>
<p>The king had been informed of his coming, and had pronounced 
that he was <i>his</i> white man, and should make haste to 
Umkingoglove, his present abode.&nbsp; The first view of this 
place, with a double circular fence around it, resembled a 
race-course, the huts being ranged along the ring of the 
enclosure so as to leave the centre free for the reviews and war 
dances of the Kaffirs.&nbsp; Gardiner was very near entering by 
the wrong gate, in which case all his escort would have been put 
to death.&nbsp; A hut was assigned to him, a sort of beehive of 
grass and mud, with a hole to enter by.&nbsp; His own lines, 
strung together in his many unoccupied moments for his 
children&rsquo;s benefit, are so good a description of the Kaffir
huts that form a kraal or village, as to be worth 
inserting:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I see them now, those four low props<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That held the haystack o&rsquo;er my head,<br />
The dusky framework from their tops<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a large mouse-trap round me spread.</p>
<p>To stand erect I never tried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For reasons you may guess:<br />
Full fourteen feet my hut was wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its height was nine feet less.</p>
<p>My furniture, a scanty store,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On saddle-bags beside me laid,<br />
A hurdle, used to close the door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Raised upon stones, my table made.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There he received a bundle of the native sugar-cane, a bowl of
maize beer from Dingarn, and was invited to his palace.</p>
<p>This was surrounded by a fence, outside which the Captain was 
desired to sit down.&nbsp; Presently a black head and very <!-- 
page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
261</span>stout pair of shoulders appeared above it, and a keen 
sable visage eyed the visitor fixedly for some time, in silence, 
which was only broken by these words, while indicating an ox, 
&ldquo;There is the beast I give you to slaughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
His black majesty then vanished, but presently to reappear from 
beneath the gateway dressed in a long blue cloak, with a white 
collar, and devices at the back.&nbsp; After directing the 
distribution of some heaps of freshly slain oxen that lay around,
he stood like a statue till a seat was brought him, and then 
entered into conversation.&nbsp; Captain Gardiner made him 
understand that trade was not the object of the visit; but the 
real purpose was quite beyond him; he seemed to regard what was 
proposed to him as an impossibility, and began to inquire after 
the presents, which, unfortunately, were still on the road.</p>
<p>The delay exposed the Captain to some inconvenience and 
danger, and two <i>indunas</i>, or chiefs, a sort of prime 
ministers, who were offended with him for not having applied to 
the king through them, treated him with increasing 
insolence.&nbsp; At last he persuaded them that he had better 
send a note to hasten the coming of the presents, and he also 
managed to write a letter for England, on his last half-sheet of 
paper, by the light of a lamp made of a rag wick floating in 
native butter in a calabash.&nbsp; From time to time he was 
called upon to witness the wonderful evolutions, man&oelig;uvres,
and mock fights in the camp.&nbsp; The men were solely soldiers; 
the women did all the work, planting maize, weeding corn, and 
herding cattle, and thus the more wives a man had the more slaves
he could employ.&nbsp; Every wife had a value, and could only be 
obtained from her father for a certain price in cattle, varying 
according to his rank.&nbsp; If the full rate were not paid, she 
remained, as well as her children, the property of her father or 
the head of her family.&nbsp; The king, having the power to help 
himself, had an establishment of ninety women, who on gala-days, 
or when his army was going to take the field, were drawn up in a 
regiment, all wearing two long feathers on the top of their 
heads, a veil of strings of coloured beads over their faces, bead
skirts, and brass rings over their throats and arms; these beads 
being the current coin of the traders.&nbsp; They approached and 
retreated in files, flourishing their arms like bell-ringers, 
while they sang:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Arise, 
vulture,<br />
Thou art the bird that eateth other birds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>These were, however, not wives, only female 
slaves.&nbsp; Either from jealousy of possible sons growing up, 
or from the desire not to be considered as in the ranks of the 
<i>umpagati</i>&mdash;elders or married men&mdash;neither Charka 
nor Dingarn would marry, and no man could take a wife without the
king&rsquo;s permission.&nbsp; Dingarn wore his head closely 
shaven, whereas the married trained their woolly hair to fasten 
over a circle of reed, so as to look much as if they had an 
inverted saucepan on their heads.&nbsp; Besides this they wore 
nothing but a sort of apron of skin before and behind, except 
when gaily arrayed in beads, or ornaments of leopard&rsquo;s fur 
and teeth, for dancing or for battle.&nbsp; Their wealth was 
their cattle, and their mealie or maize grounds; their food, 
beef, mealies, and curdled milk; their drink, beer, made of 
maize; their great luxury, snuff, made of dried dacca and burnt 
aloes, and taken from an ivory spoon.&nbsp; Though sometimes 
acting with great cruelty, and wholly ignorant, they were by no 
means a dull or indolent people; they were full of courage and 
spirit, excellent walkers and runners, capable of learning and of
thinking, and with much readiness to receive new ideas.</p>
<p>The presents arrived, and the red cloak, made of the long 
scarlet nap often used in linings, was presented, and gave 
infinite satisfaction; the king tried it on first himself, then 
judged of the effect upon the back of one of his servants, caused
it to be carried flowing through the air, and finally hung it up 
outside his palace for the admiration of his subjects, then laid 
it by for the great national festival at the feast of 
first-fruits.</p>
<p>Captain Gardiner&rsquo;s object was to obtain a house and 
piece of land and protection for a Christian missionary, and with
this object he remained at the kraal, trying to make some 
impression on Dingarn, and the two indunas, who assured him that 
they were the king&rsquo;s eyes and ears.&nbsp; Thus he became 
witness to much horrible barbarity.&nbsp; One of the least 
shocking of Dingarn&rsquo;s acts was the exhibiting the powers of
a burning-glass that had been given him, by burning a hole in the
wrist of one of his servants; and his indifference to the pain 
and death of others was frightful.&nbsp; His own brother, the 
next in succession, was, with his two servants, put to death 
through some jealousy; and, more horrible still, every living 
creature in thirty villages belonging to him was massacred as a 
matter of course.</p>
<p>Captain Gardiner, though often horrified and sickened by the 
sights he was obliged to witness, remained for a month, and then,
<!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
263</span>after accompanying the king on his march, and seeing 
some astonishing reviews and dances of his wild warriors, made 
another effort; but the king referred him to the two indunas, and
the indunas were positive that they did not wish to learn, either
they or their people.&nbsp; They would never hear nor understand 
his book, but if he would instruct them in the use of the musket 
he was welcome to stay.&nbsp; Dingarn pronounced, &ldquo;I will 
not overrule the decision of my indunas;&rdquo; but, probably 
looking on the white man as a mine of presents, he politely 
invited Gardiner to return.</p>
<p>So ended his first attempt, and with no possessions remaining 
except his clothes, his saddle, a spoon, and a Testament, he 
proceeded to the Tugela, where he met his friend Berken, who had 
made up his mind to settle in Natal, and he set out to return to 
England for the purchase of stock and implements; but the vessel 
in which he sailed was never heard of more.</p>
<p>Captain Gardiner remained at Port Natal, which in 1835 
consisted of a cluster of huts, all of them built Kaffir-fashion,
like so many hollow haycocks, except Mr. Collis&rsquo;s, which 
was regarded as English because it had upright sides, with a good
garden surrounded by reeds.&nbsp; About thirty English and a few 
Hottentots clustered around, and some three thousand Zulus, 
refugees from Dingarn&rsquo;s cruelty, who showed themselves 
ready and willing to work for hire, but who exposed their masters
to the danger of the king coming after them with fire and 
assagai.&nbsp; Hitherto on such an alarm the whole settlement had
been wont to take to the woods, but their numbers were so 
increasing that they were beginning to erect a stockade and think
of defence.</p>
<p>To this little germ of a colony, Allen Gardiner brought the 
first recollection of Christian faith and duty.&nbsp; On Sunday 
mornings he stood under a tree, as he had been wont to do on the 
deck of his ship, and read the Church Service in English to such 
as would come round him and be reminded of their homes; in the 
afternoon, by the help of his interpreter, he prayed with and for
the Kaffirs, and expounded the truths of the Gospel; and in the 
week, he kept school for such Kaffir children as he could 
collect, dressing them decently in printed calico.&nbsp; He began
with very few, partly because many parents fancied he would steal
and make slaves of them, and partly because he wished to train a 
few to be in advance and act as <!-- page 264--><a 
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>monitors to
the rest.&nbsp; The English were on very good terms with him, and
allotted a piece of land for a missionary settlement, which he 
called Berea, and began to build upon it in the fashion of the 
country.</p>
<p>Fresh threats from Dingarn led the settlers to try to come to 
a treaty with him, by which he was to leave them unmolested with 
all their Kaffirs, on their undertaking to harbour no more of his
deserters.&nbsp; There was something hard in this, considering 
the horrid barbarities from which the deserters fled, and the 
impossibility of carrying out the agreement, as no one could 
undertake to watch the Tugela; but Captain Gardiner, always eager
and hasty, thinking that he should thus secure safety for the 
colony and opportunities for the mission, undertook the embassy, 
and set forth in a waggon with two Zulus and Cyrus, falling in on
the way with one of the grotesque parties of European hunters, 
who were wont to go on expeditions after the elephant, 
hippopotamus, and buffalo, with a hunting train of Hottentots and
Kaffirs in their company.&nbsp; On whose aspect he remarks 
truly:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the savage in his wildest 
mood,<br />
And marked him reeked with human blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But never so repulsive made.<br />
Something incongruous strikes the mind<br />
Whene&rsquo;er a barbarous race we find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With shreds of civil life displayed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more of symmetry, however bare,<br />
In what a savage deigns to wear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In keeping with the scene.<br />
These, each deformed by what he wears,<br />
Like apes that dance at country fairs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seemed but a link between.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dingarn proved to be at Congella, another circular town or 
kraal, on the top of a hill.&nbsp; He gave a ready welcome to the
Captain, and his presents&mdash;some looking-glasses, a pair of 
epaulettes, and some coloured prints, especially full-lengths of 
George IV. and William IV.&nbsp; The collection in a place such 
as Natal then was must have been very hard to make, but it was 
very successful, and still more so was the Captain&rsquo;s 
presenting himself in his uniform when he went to propose the 
treaty.&nbsp; Dingarn said he must look at it before he could do 
anything else, and fully appreciated the compliment when the 
sailor said it was his war dress, in which he appeared before 
King William.&nbsp; He agreed to <!-- page 265--><a 
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>the treaty,
but declared that the English would be the first to break 
it.&nbsp; The Captain answered that a true Englishman never broke
a treaty, and that any white man who deceived was not the right 
sort of Englishman; and the king responded that &ldquo;now a 
great chief was come, to whom he could speak his 
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Captain Gardiner tried to impress on him that
it was the fear of God that made himself an honourable man, and 
to persuade him that the knowledge of the &ldquo;Book&rdquo; 
would make him and his people still greater; and the next time of
meeting set forth an outline of the morality and promises of 
Revelation.&nbsp; Dingarn was attentive, and said they were good 
words, and that he would hear more of them, but in the meantime 
Gardiner must go back to Natal and see that his people kept the 
treaty.&nbsp; It was a good deal more than he could do.&nbsp; A 
Kaffir inkosikase, or female chieftain, who, with two servants 
and three children, was fleeing into Natal at the time of his 
return, was sent back, with all her companions.&nbsp; The poor 
creatures pleaded hard that the Captain would accompany them and 
save them, and he returned with them, and interceded for them 
with all his might, but soon found they were being starved to 
death.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their bonds must kill them,&rdquo; said 
Dingarn.&nbsp; A second great effort resulted in a little food 
being sent, and a kind of promise that their lives should be 
spared; but this was only made to get rid of him, and they all 
perished after his departure.</p>
<p>Deserters, as Gardiner called the fugitives to reconcile the 
surrender to his loyal English conscience, were hardly such as 
these: they were the only ones ever sent back, and the loose wild
traders, who he ought to have known would never be bound by 
treaties, were at that very time enticing Kaffirs, who could be 
useful as herdsmen and labourers, across the frontier.&nbsp; This
led to great indignation from Dingarn, and he declared that no 
Englishman save his favourite great chief should come near 
him.</p>
<p>Meantime Gardiner was assisting an assembly of traders and 
hunters who had decided on building a town&mdash;all shaggy, 
unkempt, bearded men of the woods, who decided the spot, the 
name, the arrangements, the spot for church and 
magistrate&rsquo;s house, by vote, on the 25th of June, 1835, the
birthday of the town of Durban, so called after Sir Benjamin 
D&rsquo;Urban, Governor of the Cape, while the Portuguese name of
Natal passed to the entire territory.</p>
<p><!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>The dispute with Dingarn continuing, the Captain was 
again sent to negotiate.&nbsp; This time he was received in the 
royal mansion, a magnified beehive, where the king was lying on a
mat with his head on one of the little stools made to act as 
pillows, with about fifty women ranged round.&nbsp; As to the 
matter in question, Gardiner was able to declare that, in the 
white settlement itself, no deserters had found a home since the 
treaty, and that none should do so; Dingarn said he considered 
him the chief of the whites there, and should look to him to keep
them in order.&nbsp; Gardiner explained that he had no 
authority.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must have power,&rdquo; said 
Dingarn.&nbsp; &ldquo;I give you all the country of the white 
people&rsquo;s ford.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a piece of land 
extending from the Tugela to the Nouzincoolu, from the Snowy 
Mountains to the sea&mdash;in fact, the present whole colony of 
Natal.&nbsp; A smaller portion, including the district about 
Natal, was to be his own immediate property.&nbsp; Dingarn was 
perfectly in earnest, and thus intended to make him responsible 
for the conduct of every individual of the motley population of 
Natal, declaring that he should receive no trader who did not 
bring credentials from him.&nbsp; It was as curious a situation 
as ever commander in the navy was placed in.&nbsp; All he could 
do was to return to Durban, explain matters to Mr. Collis and the
other traders, and then set out for the Cape to consult Sir 
Benjamin Durban.</p>
<p>His journey across the mountains was very perilous and 
difficult, and took much longer than his sanguine nature had 
reckoned; but he reached Grahamstown at last, and explained 
matters to the Governor, who instantly sent off a British officer
to assume authority over the settlement at Natal, and try to keep
the peace with Dingarn, while Captain Gardiner embarked for 
England to lay the state of things before Government and the 
Church Missionary Society, at whose disposal he placed all his 
own personal grant from Dingarn.&nbsp; When the prospects of the 
mission were proclaimed, the Rev. Francis Owen volunteered for 
it, and Captain Gardiner collected all that he thought needful 
for the great work he hoped to carry out.&nbsp; He married Miss 
Marsh, of Hampstead, and, with her and his three children, Mr. 
Owen and his wife and sister, sailed on the 24th of December, 
1836; but the arrival was a sorrowful one, for his eldest child, 
a girl, of twelve years old, was slowly declining.&nbsp; She died
just as they <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>entered Durban Bay, and was buried 
at Berea immediately on their arrival.&nbsp; As soon as the 
Kaffirs heard of Captain Gardiner&rsquo;s landing, they flocked 
in to express their willingness to live under his 
authority.&nbsp; He chose a pleasant spot for his home, and 
having settled his family there, went up to see Dingarn.&nbsp; 
The presents this time were indeed ecstatically received, and 
especially a watch and seals, and a huge pair of gay worsted 
slippers.&nbsp; &ldquo;He took my measure before he went,&rdquo; 
cried Dingarn, who had tried a pair of boots before, but could 
not get them on.&nbsp; The king was made to understand that his 
gift of land must be not to the Captain, but to the King of 
England, and with this he complied.&nbsp; He was also persuaded 
to modify his demands; as to the fugitives, Gardiner undertook 
not to encourage or employ them, but would not search them out or
return them.&nbsp; Mr. Owen was also favourably received, as the 
<i>umfundisi</i> or teacher; a hut was allotted to him, and he 
was allowed to preach.&nbsp; He took up his abode at 
Umkingoglove, the first town where Captain Gardiner had seen the 
king, held services and opened a school, often holding 
conversations with the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has God commanded kings
and indunas to learn His word?&rdquo; demanded Dingarn; and he 
actually did learn to read the words printed upon a card for the 
children.</p>
<p>Meantime Captain Gardiner was forming his settlement at a 
place which he had named in the Kaffir tongue, Hambanati, 
&ldquo;Go with us,&rdquo; in allusion to Moses&rsquo; invitation 
to Hobab: &ldquo;Go with us, and we will do thee 
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was half-way between Durban Bay and the 
Tugela, on a hill-side in the midst of the beautiful undulating 
ground and rich wood characteristic of the country, and with a 
river in front.&nbsp; There he had raised a thatched house for 
himself, and around it Zulu huts were continually 
multiplying.&nbsp; The English carpenter and labourers whom he 
had brought out instructed the Kaffirs in various kinds of 
labour, for which they were quite willing; and as they wore 
decent garments, they were called the clothed tribe.&nbsp; School
was kept for the children in the week; for the grown-up people on
Sunday; and on every alternate morning some Scripture fact was 
read and explained to them, the Captain still being obliged to 
act as chaplain, until the arrival of Mr. Hewetson, whom the 
Church Missionary Society were sending out.</p>
<p>Never had the generous toil of a devoted man seemed likely to 
meet with better success, when a storm came from a most <!-- page
268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
268</span>unexpected quarter.&nbsp; The original colonists of the
Cape of Good Hope were Dutch, and the whole district was peopled 
with boers or farmers of that nation, stolid, prosperous, and 
entirely uncontrolled by public opinion.&nbsp; They had treated 
the unfortunate Hottentots as slaves, with all the cruelty of 
stupidity, and imported Malays and Negroes to work in the same 
manner; and they had shown, even when under their native state, a
sort of grim turbulence that made them very hard to deal 
with.&nbsp; When in 1834 the British Government emancipated their
slaves, and made cruelty penal and labour necessarily 
remunerative, their discontent was immense, and a great number 
sold their farms, and moved off into the interior to form an 
independent settlement on the Orange River.&nbsp; A large number 
of them, however, hearing of Dingarn&rsquo;s liberality to 
Captain Gardiner, were determined to extort a similar grant to 
themselves by a display of power.&nbsp; First came a letter, 
which Mr. Owen had to read and interpret to the chief, and not 
long after a large deputation arrived, armed and mounted on 
strong horses.&nbsp; Dingarn showed them a war-dance, and they in
return said they would show how the boers danced on horseback, 
and exhibited a sham-fight, which did indeed alarm the savage, 
but, so far from daunting him, only excited his treachery and 
fierceness.&nbsp; He gave a sort of general answer, and the 
messengers retired.&nbsp; But from that time his interest in Mr. 
Owen&rsquo;s teaching flagged; he wanted fire-arms instead of 
religion, and preachings led to cavillings.&nbsp; Indications of 
evil intentions likewise reached Captain Gardiner, who sent to 
warn Mr. Owen, and to offer him a refuge at Hambanati in case of 
need.&nbsp; Still Mr. Owen could gather nothing; he was called 
from time to time to read the Dutchmen&rsquo;s letters, but was 
never told how they were to be dealt with.&nbsp; In fact, Dingarn
had replied by an offer of the very district he had given Captain
Gardiner, on condition that the new-comers would recover some 
cattle which had been carried off by a hostile tribe.&nbsp; This 
was done, and the detachment which had been employed on the 
service arrived at Umkingoglove, where they were welcomed with 
war-dances, and exhibited their own sham-fights; but in the midst
of the ensuing meal they were suddenly surrounded by a huge 
circle of the Zulus, as if for another war-dance.&nbsp; The black
ring came nearer and nearer still, and finally rushed in upon the
unhappy boers, and slaughtered every man of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Owen had suspected nothing of what was passing, till <!-- 
page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
269</span>he received a message from Dingarn that he need not 
fear; the boers had been killed for plotting, but the umfundisi 
should not be hurt.&nbsp; A time of terrible anxiety followed, 
during which the Owen family saw large bodies of the Kaffir army 
marching towards the Tugela, and in effect they fell upon the 
Dutch camp, and upwards of a hundred and fifty white men, women, 
and children were massacred.&nbsp; This horrible act, showing 
that no reliance could be placed on Dingarn&rsquo;s promise, made
the Owens decide on leaving Umkingoglove, and they arrived at 
Hambanati, whence they proceeded to Durban.&nbsp; The Gardiner 
family waited for another week; but, finding the whole of the 
settlers infuriated, and bent on joining the Dutch in a war of 
extermination against Dingarn, they were obliged to retreat to 
the coast.&nbsp; First, however, Captain Gardiner assembled his 
Kaffirs, and promised to do his utmost to find another tract, 
where they might settle in peace, if they would abstain from all 
share in the coming war.&nbsp; They promised; but in his absence 
the promise was not easy to keep; they joined in the fight, many 
were killed, and the settlement entirely broken up.&nbsp; The 
cause seemed to Gardiner hopeless; and, after waiting for a short
time in Algoa Bay, he decided on leaving the scene of action, 
where peaceful teaching could not prevail for some time to 
come.&nbsp; Whether it would not have been better to have tarried
a little while, and then to have availed himself of the 
confidence and affection he had inspired, so as to gather the 
remnants of his mission again, we cannot say.&nbsp; At any rate, 
he consoled himself for the disastrous failure at Natal by 
setting forth on a fresh scheme of Christian knight-errantry on 
behalf of the Indians of South America.</p>
<p>Long ago, in Brazil, the Jesuits had done their best to 
Christianize and protect the Indians; but the Portuguese settlers
had, as usual, savagely resented any interference with their 
cruel oppressions, broken up the Jesuit settlement, and sold 
their unfortunate converts as slaves.&nbsp; After this, the 
Jesuit Fathers had formed excellent establishments in the more 
independent country of Paraguay, lying to the south, where they 
had many churches, and peaceful, prosperous, happy communities of
Christian Indians around them.&nbsp; South American Indians are 
essentially childish beings; and the Jesuits, when providing 
labour enough to occupy them wholesomely, found themselves 
obliged to undertake the disposal of the produce, thus not merely
rendering <!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>their mission self-supporting, but 
so increasing the wealth of the already powerful Order as to 
render it a still greater object of jealousy to the European 
potentates; and when, in the eighteenth century, the tide of 
opposition set strongly against it, the unecclesiastical traffic 
of the settlements in Paraguay was one of the accusations.&nbsp; 
The result was, that the Jesuit Fathers were banished from South 
America in 1767; and whether it was that they had neglected to 
train the Indians in self-reliance, or whether it was impossible 
to do so, their departure led to an immediate collapse into 
barbarism; nor had anything since been done on behalf of the 
neglected race.&nbsp; Indeed, the break-up of all Spanish 
authority had been doubly fatal to the natives, by removing all 
protection, and leaving them to the self-interested violence of 
the petty republics, unrestrained by any loftier 
consideration.</p>
<p>In the Republic of Buenos Ayres, under the dictatorship of 
General Rosas, the lot of these poor creatures was specially 
cruel.&nbsp; A war of extermination was carried on against them, 
and eighty had at one time been shot together in the market-place
of the capital.&nbsp; Nothing could be done towards reclaiming 
them while so savage a warfare lasted; but Gardiner hoped to push
on to the more northerly tribes, on the borders of Chili, and he 
took a journey to reconnoitre across the Pampas, with many 
strange hardships and adventures; but he found always the same 
story,&mdash;the Indians regarded as wild beasts, and, acting 
only too much as such, falling by night on solitary ranchos, or 
on lonely travellers, and murdering them, and, on the other hand,
being shot down wherever they were found.</p>
<p>With great difficulty and perseverance he made his way to the 
Biobio river, leaving his family at Concep&ccedil;ion, the 
nearest comparatively civilized place.&nbsp; Here he meant to 
make his way to a village of independent Indians, with whose 
chief, Corbalan, he had hopes of entering into relations.</p>
<p>To cross the rapid stream of the Biobio, he had to use a 
primitive raft, formed of four trunks of trees, about eighteen 
feet long, lashed together by hide-thongs to two poles, one at 
each end.&nbsp; A horse was fastened to it, by knotting his tail 
to the tow-rope, and on his back was a boy, holding on by the 
single lock of the mane that is allowed to remain on Chilian 
horses, who guided him across with much entreating, urging, and 
coaxing.&nbsp; On the other side appeared Corbalan, the Indian 
<!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
271</span>chief on horseback, and in a dark poncho, a sort of 
round cloak, with a hole to admit the head, much worn all over 
South America.&nbsp; He took Captain Gardiner to his house, an 
oval, with wattled side-walls, about five feet high and 
thirty-five long, neatly thatched with grass, with a fireplace in
the centre, where a sheep was cooked for supper.&nbsp; Corbalan 
could speak Spanish, and seemed to be pleased with the visit, 
making an agreement that he should teach Gardiner his Indian 
tongue, and, in return, be instructed in the way of God and 
heaven.&nbsp; He had convened forty-five of his people, among 
whom were five chiefs, each of whom made the visitor the offering
of a boiled chicken, while he gave them some coloured cotton 
handkerchiefs and some brass buttons.&nbsp; It was a beautiful 
country, and reminded the guest so much of some parts of England,
that it needed a glance at the brown skin, flowing hair, and long
poncho of Corbalan to dispel the illusion that he was near 
home.&nbsp; Things looked so favourable, that he had even 
selected a site for the mission-house, when some change of 
sentiment came over Corbalan, probably from the remonstrances of 
his fellow-chiefs: he declared that a warlike tribe near at hand 
would not suffer him to harbour a stranger, and that he must 
therefore withdraw his invitation.</p>
<p>So ended this attempt; and the indefatigable Captain turned 
his attention to the Indians to the southward, but he found that 
these were on good terms with the Chilian Government, and that no
one could come among them without a pass from thence; and, as 
there was a cautious attempt at Christianizing then going on, by 
persuading the cacique to be baptized and to admit priests to 
their villages, there was both the less need and the less opening
for him.</p>
<p>So, picking up his wife and children again at 
Concep&ccedil;ion, he sailed with them for Valdivia, where, as 
wandering Europeans were always supposed to be in search of 
objects for museums, and perhaps from some confusion about his 
name, he was called &ldquo;El Botanico.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he 
plunged among the Indians; but, wherever he came to a peaceable 
tribe, they were under the influence of Spanish clergy, who were,
of course, determined to exclude him, while the warlike and 
independent Indians could not understand the difference between 
him and their Spanish enemies; and thus, after two years of 
effort, he found that no opening existed for reaching these wild 
people.&nbsp; A proposal was made to him to remain and act as an 
agent for the <!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>Bible and Tract Societies among the 
South American Roman Catholics, but this he rejected.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have devoted myself to God, 
to seek for openings among the heathen, and I cannot go back or 
modify my vow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Malay Archipelago was his next goal.&nbsp; He sailed with 
his wife and children from Valparaiso for Sydney on the 29th of 
May, 1839, but the vessel got out of her course, and was forced 
to put in at Tahiti, where he found things sadly changed by the 
aggression of Louis Philippe&rsquo;s Government, which had 
claimed the protectorate.&nbsp; The troubles of Queen 
Pomare&rsquo;s reign were at their height, and the conflict 
between French and English, Roman Catholic and Protestant, 
prevented any efficient struggle against the corruption 
introduced by the crews of all nations.</p>
<p>The great savage island of New Guinea seemed to Captain 
Gardiner a field calling for labour, and, on his arrival in 
Australia, he found that the Roman Catholic Bishop of Sydney was 
trying to organize a mission.&nbsp; He left Australia, hoping to 
obtain permission from the Dutch authorities at Timor to proceed 
to Papua, to take steps for being beforehand with the Australian 
expedition.&nbsp; He reached the place with great difficulty, and
he himself, and all his family, began to suffer severely from 
fever.&nbsp; The Dutch governor told him that he might as well 
try to teach the monkeys as the Papuans, and the Dutch clergy 
gave him very little encouragement.&nbsp; He remained in these 
strange and beautiful islands for several months, trying one 
Dutch governor after another, and always finding them civil but 
impenetrable; for, in fact, they could not believe that an 
officer in her Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s Navy could be purely 
actuated by missionary zeal, but thought that it concealed some 
political object.&nbsp; They were not more gracious even to 
clergy of other nations.&nbsp; He found an American missionary at
Macassar, whom they had detained, and some Germans, who were 
vainly entreating to be allowed to proceed to Borneo; and his 
efforts met only with the most baffling, passive, but systematic 
denial.&nbsp; It was reserved for the enterprise and prudence of 
Sir James Brooke to open a way in this quarter.</p>
<p>The health of the Gardiner family had been much injured by 
their residence in those lovely but unwholesome countries, but 
the voyage to Capetown restored it; and immediately after they 
sailed again for South America, where the Captain had <!-- page 
273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
273</span>heard of an Indian tribe in the passes of the 
Cordilleras, who seemed more possible of access.&nbsp; Here again
he was baffled in his dealings with the local government by the 
suspicions of the priests, and never could obtain the means of 
penetrating beyond the city of San Carlos, so that he decided at 
last to repair to the Falkland Islands, and make an endeavour 
thence to reach the people of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, 
where no hostile Church should put stumbling-blocks in his 
way.</p>
<p>A doleful region he found those Falkland Isles, covered only 
with their peculiar grass and short heather, and without a 
tree.&nbsp; A little wooden cottage, brought from Valparaiso, 
sheltered the much-enduring Mrs. Gardiner and the two children, 
while the Captain looked out for a vessel to take him to 
Patagonia; but he found that no one ever went there, and the 
whalers who made these dismal islands their station did not wish 
to go out of their course.&nbsp; Captain Gardiner offered 
200<i>l.</i>, the probable value of a whole whale, as the price 
of his passage; but the skippers told him that, though they would
willingly take him anywhere for nothing, they could not go out of
their course.</p>
<p>To seek the most hopeless and uncultivated was always this 
good man&rsquo;s object.&nbsp; The Falkland Isles were dreary 
enough, but they were a paradise compared to the desolate fag-end
of the American world,&mdash;a cluster of barren rocks, 
intersected by arms of the sea, which divide them into numerous 
islets, the larger ones bearing stunted forests of beech and 
birch, on the skirts of hills covered with perpetual snow, and 
sending down blue glaciers to the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; The 
narrower channels are very shallow; the wider, rough and 
storm-tossed; and scarcely anything edible grows on the 
islands.&nbsp; The Fuegians are as degraded a people as any on 
the face of the earth, with just intelligence enough to maintain 
themselves by hunting and fishing, by the help of dogs, which, it
is said, they prize so much that they would rather, in time of 
scarcity, eat up an old mother than a dog; and they are 
churlishly inhospitable to strangers, although with an unusual 
facility for imitating their language, nor had any one ever 
attempted their conversion.</p>
<p>However, the master of the <i>Montgomery</i>, who had brought 
the Gardiners out to the Falkland Islands, hearing of the offer, 
undertook such a profitable expedition; but his schooner was 
utterly frail, had to be caulked and to borrow a sail, and, as he
was losing no whales, Captain Gardiner refused to give more <!-- 
page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
274</span>than 100<i>l.</i>, a sufficiently exorbitant sum, for 
the passage of himself and a servant named Johnstone.&nbsp; While
the crazy vessel was refitting a Sunday intervened, during which 
he offered to hold a service, but only two men attended it, the 
rest were all absent or intoxicated.</p>
<p>The poor little ship put to sea, and struggled into the 
Straits of Magelhaen, drifting near the Fuegian coast.&nbsp; 
Landing, the Captain lighted a fire to attract the attention of 
the natives, and some came down and shouted.&nbsp; The English 
did not, however, think it safe to go further from the boat, and 
presently the Fuegians likewise kindled their fire, whereupon 
Gardiner heaped more fuel on his own, and continued his signals, 
when two men advanced, descending to the beach.&nbsp; They were 
clad in cloaks of the skin of the guanaco, a small kind of llama,
and were about five feet ten in height, with broad shoulders and 
chests, but lean, disproportionate legs.&nbsp; Each carried a bow
and quiver of arrows; and they spoke loudly, making evident signs
that the strangers were unwelcome.&nbsp; Presents were offered 
them; brass buttons, a clasp knife, and worsted comforter; and 
they sat down, but apparently with a sullen resolution not to 
relax their faces, nor utter another word.&nbsp; A small 
looking-glass was handed to one of them, and he was grimly 
putting it under his cloak when Captain Gardiner held it up to 
him, and he laughed at the reflection of his own face; and his 
friend then looked at the knife, as if expecting it to produce 
the same effect, but, though they seemed to appreciate it, they 
made no friendly sign, and appeared unmoved when spoken to either
in Spanish or in the few Patagonian phrases that Captain Gardiner
had managed to pick up; nor did anything seem to afford them any 
satisfaction except demonstrations of departure.</p>
<p>Nothing seemed practicable with these uncouth, distrustful 
beings, and the Captain therefore went on in search of a tribe of
Patagonians, among which, he was told, was a Creole Spaniard 
named San Leon, who had acquired great influence by his reckless 
courage and daring, and through whom it might be possible to have
some communication with them.&nbsp; The camp of these people on 
the main continent, near Cape Gregory, was discovered newly 
deserted, with hollow places in the ground where fires had been 
made, and many marks of footsteps.&nbsp; This extreme point of 
the continent was by no means so dreary as the Land of Fire; it 
bore thorny bushes ten feet <!-- page 275--><a 
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>high, wild 
celery and clover, and cranberry-bushes covered with red 
berries.&nbsp; Indeed, the Patagonians&mdash;so called because 
their big splay boots made Magelhaen conclude they walked on 
<i>patas</i> (paws), like bears&mdash;are a superior race to the 
Fuegians, larger in stature than most Europeans, great riders, 
and clever in catching guanacos by means of bolas, <i>i.e.</i> 
two round stones attached to a string.&nbsp; If the Fuegians are 
Antarctic Esquimaux, the Patagonians are Antarctic Tartars, 
leading a wandering life under tents made of skins of horses and 
guanacos, and hating all settled habits, but not so utterly 
inhospitable and impracticable as their neighbours beyond the 
Strait.&nbsp; In truth, the division is not clearly marked, for 
there are Fuegians on the continent and Patagonians in the 
islands.&nbsp; Ascending a height, the Captain took a survey of 
the country, and, seeing two wreaths of smoke near Oazy Harbour, 
sailed in, cast anchor, and in the morning was visited by the 
natives of their own accord, after which he returned with them to
their camp, consisting of horse-hide tents, semicircular in form,
and entirely open.&nbsp; They were full of men, women, and 
children, and among them San Leon, to whom it was possible to 
talk in Spanish, and indeed several natives, from intercourse 
with ships, knew a few words of English.&nbsp; San Leon had been 
with the tribe for twelve years, and said that American 
missionaries had visited them, but that they had gone away 
because the Fuegians who crossed the Strait were such thieves 
that they ate up their provisions and cut up their books.&nbsp; 
However, no objection was made to Gardiner&rsquo;s remaining, so 
he set up a tarred canvas tent, closed at each end with 
bullock-hides, and slept on shore, a good deal disturbed by the 
dogs, who gnawed at the bullock-hides, till a coat of tar laid 
over them prevented them.&nbsp; Not so, however, with another 
visitor, a huge Patagonian, who walked in with the words, 
&ldquo;I go sleep,&rdquo; and leisurely coiled himself up for the
purpose, unheeding Johnstone&rsquo;s discourse; but the Captain, 
pointing with his finger, and emphatically saying 
&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; produced the desired effect.&nbsp; Then 
followed the erection of seventeen skin tents, all in a row, set 
up by the women.&nbsp; These Patagonians behaved well and 
quietly; but, in the meantime, the master of the schooner had 
asked San Leon to obtain some guanaco meat for the crew, and the 
natives who went in search of the animals insisted on being paid,
though they had caught nothing.&nbsp; These however were 
Fuegians, and <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>the Patagonians were very angry with
them.&nbsp; Captain Gardiner even ventured to remain alone with 
Johnstone among this people, while San Leon went on to Port 
Famine in the <i>Montgomery</i>, which was in search of wood; 
but, in the meantime, he could do nothing but hold a little 
monosyllabic communication; and once, when he and his servant 
both went out at the same time, they lost their dinner, which, 
left to simmer over the fire, proved irresistible to the 
Patagonians.&nbsp; They, however, differed from the Fuegians in 
not ordinarily being thieves.</p>
<p>A chief named Wissale arrived with a body of his tribe with 
whom he had been purchasing horses on the Rio Negro, and bringing
with him an American negro named Isaac, who had three years since
run away from a whaler, and who spoke enough English to be a 
useful interpreter.</p>
<p>Wissale, with Isaac&rsquo;s help, was made to perceive Captain
Gardiner&rsquo;s intentions sufficiently to promise to make him 
welcome if he should return, and to declare that he should be 
glad to learn good things.&nbsp; There seemed so favourable an 
opening that the Captain made up his mind to take up his abode 
there with his family to prepare the way for a missionary in Holy
Orders, for whom he never deemed himself more than a pioneer.</p>
<p>After distributing presents to the friendly Patagonians, he 
embarked, and making a weary passage, reached the Falkland 
Islands, where he found the two ships <i>Erebus</i> and 
<i>Terror</i> anchored, in the course of their voyage of 
Antarctic discovery.&nbsp; The presence of the two captains and 
their officers was a great pleasure and enlivenment to the 
Gardiners, who received from them many comforts very needful in 
that inclement climate to people lately come from some of the 
hottest regions of the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Whalers continually put in, but not one, even though Captain 
Gardiner&rsquo;s offers rose to 300<i>l.</i>, would undertake to 
go out of his course to Patagonia to convey him and his family, 
and he would not trust his wife and children on board that 
wretched craft the <i>Montgomery</i>, so he waited on at the 
Falkland Islands, doing what good he could there, and expecting 
the answer of a letter he had despatched to the Church Missionary
Society, begging for the appointment of a clergyman to this field
of labour.&nbsp; After six months&rsquo; delay, the letter came, 
and proved to be unfavourable; there was a falling off in the 
funds of the Society, and a new and doubtful mission was thought 
undesirable.&nbsp; <!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>The Captain believed that nothing 
but personal representations could prevail, and therefore decided
on going home to plead the cause of his Patagonians.&nbsp; He 
sailed with his family for Rio in a small vessel, and the voyage 
could not have been one of the least of the dangers, for the 
skipper was a Guacho who had been a shoemaker, and knew nothing 
about seafaring, and there was not a spare rope in the 
ship.&nbsp; From Rio Gardiner took a passage home, and safely 
arrived, after six years of brave pioneering in three different 
quarters of the globe.</p>
<p>He found, however, that the Church Missionary Society could 
not undertake the Patagonian Mission, and neither could the 
London nor Wesleyan Societies.&nbsp; He declared that every one 
grew cold when they heard of South America, and viewed it as the 
natural inheritance of Giants Pope and Pagan; and for this very 
reason he was the more bent upon doing his utmost.&nbsp; Failing 
in his attack on Pagan he made an assault on Pope, obtaining a 
grant of Bibles, Testaments, and tracts from the Bible Society, 
and in 1843 sailed for Rio to distribute them; this time, 
however, going alone, as his children were of an age to require 
an English education and an English home.</p>
<p>He undertook this mission, in fact, chiefly for the purpose of
continuing his attempts to reach the Indian tribes.&nbsp; His 
journey was, as usual, wild and adventurous, and its principal 
result was an acquaintance with the English chaplains and 
congregations at several of the chief South American ports, from 
whom he received a promise of 100<i>l.</i>, per annum for the 
support of a mission to Patagonia.</p>
<p>With this beginning he returned home, and while residing at 
Brighton, his earnestness so stirred people&rsquo;s minds that a 
Society was formed with an income of 500<i>l.</i>, and Mr. Robert
Hunt, giving up the mastership of an endowed school, offered 
himself to the Church Missionary Society.&nbsp; A clergyman could
not immediately be found, and it was determined that these two 
should go first and prepare the way.&nbsp; In 1844, then, they 
landed in Oazy Harbour in Magelhaen&rsquo;s Straits, and set up 
three tents, one for stores, one for cooking, and one for 
sleeping.&nbsp; One Fuegian hut was near, where the people were 
inoffensive, and presently there arrived a Chilian deserter named
Mariano, who said that he had run away from the fort at Port 
Famine with another man named Cruz, who had remained among the 
Patagonians.&nbsp; He reported that Wissale had lost much of his 
authority, and <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>that San Leon was now chief of the 
tribe; also that there was a Padre Domingo at Port Famine, who 
was teaching the Patagonians to become 
&ldquo;Catolicos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To learn the truth as soon as possible, the Captain and Mr. 
Hunt locked up two of their huts, leaving the other for Mariano, 
and set off in search of the Patagonians; and a severe journey it
was, as they had to carry the heavy clothing required to keep up 
warmth at night, besides their food, gun, powder, and shot.&nbsp;
The fatigue was too much for Hunt, who was at one time obliged to
lie down exhausted while the Captain went in search of water; and
after four days they were obliged to return to their huts, where 
shortly after Wissale arrived, but with a very scanty following, 
only ten or twelve horses, and himself and family very hungry; 
but though ready to eat whatever Captain Gardiner would give him,
his whole manner was changed by his disasters.&nbsp; He was surly
and quarrelsome, and evidently under the influence of the 
deserter Cruz, who was resolved to set him against the 
new-comers, and so worked upon him that he once threatened the 
Captain with his dirk.&nbsp; Moreover, a Chilian vessel arrived, 
bringing Padre Mariano himself, a Spanish South American, with a 
real zeal for conversion, though he was very courteous to the 
Englishmen.&nbsp; An English vessel arrived about the same time, 
and Gardiner, thinking the cause for the present hopeless, 
accepted a homeward passage, writing in his journal, &ldquo;We 
can never do wrong in casting the Gospel net on any side or in 
any place.&nbsp; During many a dark and wearisome night we may 
appear to have toiled in vain, but it will not be always 
so.&nbsp; If we will but wait the appointed time, the promise, 
though long delayed, will assuredly come to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if he was not daunted his supporters were, and nothing but
his intense earnestness, and assurance that he should never 
abandon South America, prevented the whole cause from being 
dropped.&nbsp; His next attempt was to reach the Indians beyond 
Bolivia, in the company of Federigo Gonzales, a Spaniard, who had
become a Protestant, and was to have gone on the Patagonian 
Mission.&nbsp; Here fever became their enemy, but after much 
suffering and opposition Gonzales was settled at Potosi, studying
the Quichuan language, and hoping to work upon the Indians, while
the unwearied Gardiner again returned to England to strain every 
nerve for the Fuegian Mission, which lay nearest of all to his 
heart.</p>
<p><!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>He travelled all over England and Scotland, lecturing 
and making collections, speaking with the same energy whether he 
had few or many auditors.&nbsp; At one town, when asked what sort
of a meeting he had had, he answered, &ldquo;Not very good, but 
better than sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many were present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one; but no meeting is better than a bad 
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not obtain means enough for a well-appointed 
expedition such as he wished for; but he urged that a small 
experimental one might be sent out, consisting of himself, four 
sailors, one carpenter, with three boats, two huts, and 
provisions for half a year.&nbsp; He hoped to establish a station
on Staten Island, whence the Fuegians could be visited, and the 
stores kept out of their reach.</p>
<p>Having found the men, he embarked on board the barque 
<i>Clymene</i>, which was bound for Payta, in Peru, and was 
landed on Picton Island; but before the vessel had departed the 
Fuegians had beset the little party, and shown themselves so 
obstinately and mischievously thievish, that it was plainly 
impossible for so small a party to hold their ground among 
them.&nbsp; Before there could be a possibility of convincing 
them of even the temporal benefit of the white man&rsquo;s 
residence among them, they would have stripped and carried off 
everything from persons who would refrain from hurting 
them.&nbsp; So, once more, the Captain drew up the net which had 
taken nothing, decided that the only mission which would suit the
Fuegians must be afloat, and went on to Payta in the 
<i>Clymene</i>.</p>
<p>While in Peru, he met with a Spanish lady, who asked if he 
knew a friend of hers who came from Genoa, and then proceeded to 
inquire which was the largest city, Genoa or Italy, and if Europe
was not a little on this side of Spain, while a priest asked if 
London was a part of France.&nbsp; After spending a little time 
in distributing Bibles in Peru, he made his way home by the way 
of Panama, and on his arrival made an attempt to interest the 
Moravians in the cause so near his heart, thinking that what they
had done in Greenland proved their power of dealing with that 
savage apathy that springs from inclemency of climate, but the 
mission was by them pronounced impracticable.</p>
<p>In the meantime, his former ground, Port Natal, was in a more 
hopeful state.&nbsp; Tremendous battles had been fought <!-- page
280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
280</span>between Dingarn and the boers; but, in 1839, Panda, 
Dingarn&rsquo;s brother, finding his life threatened, went over 
to the enemy, carrying 4,000 men with him, and thus turned the 
scale.&nbsp; Dingarn was routed, fled, and was murdered by the 
tribe with whom he had taken refuge, and Panda became Zulu king, 
while the boers occupied Natal, and founded the city of Pieter 
Maritzburg as the capital of a Republic; but the disputes between
them and the Zulus led to the interference of the Governor of the
Cape, and finally Natal was made a British colony, with the 
Tugela for a boundary; and, as Panda&rsquo;s government was 
exceedingly violent and bloody, his subjects were continually 
flocking across the river to put themselves under British 
protection, and were received on condition of paying a small 
yearly rate for every hut in each kraal, and conforming 
themselves to English law, so far as regarded the suppression of 
violence and theft.&nbsp; One of the survivors of 
Gardiner&rsquo;s old pupils, meeting a gentleman who was going to
England, sent him the following message: &ldquo;Tell Cappan Garna
he promise to come again if his hair was as white as his shirt, 
and we are waiting for him;&rdquo; and he added a little calabash
snuff-box as a token.&nbsp; But the Captain had made his promise 
to return contingent upon the Kaffirs of his settlement taking no
part in the war, and they, poor things, had, with the single 
exception of his own personal attendant, Umpondombeni, broken 
this condition; so that he did not deem himself bound by 
it.&nbsp; Moreover, means were being taken for providing a 
mission for Natal, and Christian teachers were already there, 
while he regarded his own personal exertions as the only hope for
the desolate natives of Cape Horn.&nbsp; So he only sent a letter
and a present to the man, urging him to attach himself to a 
mission-station, and then turned again to his unwearied labour in
the Patagonian and Fuegian cause.&nbsp; His little Society found 
it impossible to raise means for the purchase of a brigantine, 
and he therefore limited his plans to the equipment of two 
launches and two smaller boats.&nbsp; He would store in these 
provisions for six months, and take a crew of Cornish fishermen, 
used to the stormy Irish Sea.&nbsp; As to the funds, a lady at 
Cheltenham gave 700<i>l.</i>, he himself 300<i>l.</i>&nbsp; The 
boats were purchased, three Cornishmen, named Pearce, Badcock, 
and Bryant, all of good character, volunteered from the same 
village; Joseph Erwin, the carpenter, who had been with him 
before, begged to go with him again, because, he said, 
&ldquo;being <!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>with Captain Gardiner was like a 
heaven upon earth; he was such a man of prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; One 
catechist was Richard Williams, a surgeon; the other John 
Maidment, who was pointed out by the secretary of the Young 
Men&rsquo;s Association in London; and these seven persons, with 
their two launches, the <i>Pioneer</i> and the <i>Speedwell</i>, 
were embarked on board the <i>Ocean Queen</i>, and sailed from 
Liverpool on the 7th of September, 1850.&nbsp; They carried with 
them six months&rsquo; provisions, and the committee were to send
the same quantity out in due time, but they failed to find a ship
that would undertake to go out of its course to Picton Island, 
and therefore could only send the stores to the Falklands, to be 
thence despatched by a ship that was reported to go monthly to 
Tierra del Fuego for wood.</p>
<p>Meantime, the seven, with their boats and their provisions, 
were landed on Picton Island, and the <i>Ocean Queen</i> pursued 
her way.&nbsp; Time passed on, and no more was heard of 
them.&nbsp; The Governor of the Falklands had twice made 
arrangements for ships to touch at Picton Island, but the first 
master was wrecked, the second disobeyed him; and in great 
anxiety, on the discovery of this second failure, he sent, in 
October 1851, a vessel on purpose to search for them.&nbsp; At 
the same time, the <i>Dido</i>, Captain William Morshead, had 
been commanded by the Admiralty to touch at the isles of Cape 
Horn and carry relief to the missionaries.</p>
<p>On the 21st of October, in a lonely little bay called 
Spaniards&rsquo; Harbour, in Picton Island, the Falkland Island 
vessel found the <i>Speedwell</i> on the beach, and near it an 
open grave.&nbsp; In the boat lay one body, near the grave 
another.&nbsp; They returned with these tidings, and in the 
meantime the <i>Dido</i> having come out, her boats explored the 
coast, and a mile and a half beyond the first found the other 
boat, beside which lay a skeleton, the dress of which showed it 
to be the remains of Allen Gardiner.&nbsp; Near at hand was a 
cavern, outside which were these words painted, beneath a 
hand:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My soul, wait thou still upon God, for my 
hope is in Him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He truly is my strength and my salvation; He is my 
defence, so that I shall not fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In God is my strength and my glory; the rock of my 
might, and in God is my trust.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the cave lay another body, that of Maidment.&nbsp; 
Reverent hands collected the remains and dug a grave; the <!-- 
page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
282</span>funeral service was read by one of the officers, the 
ship&rsquo;s colours were hung half-mast high, and three volleys 
of musketry fired over the grave&mdash;&ldquo;the only tribute of
respect,&rdquo; says Captain Morshead, &ldquo;I could pay to this
lofty-minded man and his devoted companions who have perished in 
the cause of the Gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no doubt of the 
cause and manner of their death, for Captain Gardiner&rsquo;s 
diary was found written up to probably the last day of his 
life.</p>
<p>It appeared that in their first voyage, on the 20th of 
December, they had fallen in with a heavy sea, and a great drift 
of seaweed, in which the anchor of the <i>Speedwell</i> and the 
two lesser boats had been hopelessly entangled and lost.&nbsp; It
was found impossible for such small numbers to manage the 
launches in the stormy channels while loaded, and it was 
therefore resolved to lighten them by burying the stores at 
Banner Cove, and, while this was being done, it was discovered 
that all the ammunition, except one flask and a half of powder, 
had been left behind in the <i>Ocean Queen</i>; so that there was
no means of obtaining either guanacos or birds.&nbsp; Attempts 
were made at establishing friendly barter with the natives, but 
no sooner did these perceive the smallness of the number of the 
strangers, than they beset them with obstinate hostility.&nbsp; 
Meantime, Gardiner&rsquo;s object was to reach a certain Button 
Island, where was a man called Jemmy Button, who had had much 
intercourse with English sailors, and who, he hoped, might pave 
the way for a better understanding with the natives.</p>
<p>But the <i>Pioneer</i> had been damaged from the first, and 
could not go so far.&nbsp; At Banner Cove the natives were 
hostile and troublesome, and Spaniards&rsquo; Harbour was the 
only refuge, and even there a furious wind, on the 1st of 
February, drove the <i>Pioneer</i> ashore against the jagged root
of a tree, so as to damage her past all her crew&rsquo;s power of
mending, though they hauled her higher up on the beach, and, by 
the help of a tent, made a lodging for the night of the wreck 
close to the cave, which they called after her name.</p>
<p>The question then was, whether to place all the seven in the 
<i>Speedwell</i> with some of the provisions and make for Button 
Island, and this might probably have saved their lives; but they 
had already experienced the exceeding difficulty of navigating 
the launch in the heavy seas.&nbsp; Both their landing boats were
lost, and they therefore decided to remain where they were <!-- 
page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
283</span>until the arrival of the vessel with supplies, which 
they confidently expected either from home or from the 
Falklands.&nbsp; Indeed, their power of moving away was soon 
lost, for Williams, the surgeon, and Badcock, one of the 
Cornishmen, both fell ill of the scurvy.&nbsp; The cold was 
severe, and neither fresh meat nor green food was to be had, and 
this in February&mdash;the southern August.&nbsp; However, the 
patients improved enough to enable the party to make a last 
expedition to Banner Cove to recover more of the provisions 
buried there, and to paint notices upon the rocks to guide the 
hoped-for relief to Spaniards&rsquo; Harbour; but this was not 
effected without much molestation from the Fuegians.&nbsp; Then 
passed six weary months of patient expectation and hope 
deferred.&nbsp; There was no murmuring, no insubordination, while
these seven men waited&mdash;waited&mdash;waited in vain, through
the dismal Antarctic winter for the relief that came too 
late.&nbsp; The journals of Williams and Gardiner breathe nothing
but hopeful, resigned trust, and comfort in the heavenly-minded 
resolution of each of the devoted band, who may almost be said to
have been the Theban legion of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>For a month they were able to procure fish, and were not put 
on short allowance till April, when Williams and Badcock both 
became worse, and Bryant began to fail, though he never took to 
his bed.&nbsp; They, with Erwin, were lodged in the 
<i>Speedwell</i> at Blomfield Harbour, a sheltered inlet, about a
mile and a half from the wreck of the <i>Pioneer</i>, where, to 
leave the sick more room, Captain Gardiner lodged with Maidment 
and Pearce.</p>
<p>With the months whose names spoke of English summer, storms 
and terrible cold began to set in.&nbsp; The verses that Gardiner
wrote in his diary during this frightful period are inexpressibly
touching in the wondrous strength of their faith and 
cheerfulness.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let that sweet word our spirits cheer<br />
Which quelled the tossed disciples&rsquo; fear:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Be not afraid!&rsquo;<br />
He who could bid the tempest cease<br />
Can keep our souls in perfect peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If on Him stayed.<br />
And we shall own &rsquo;twas good to wait:<br />
No blessing ever came too late.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was written on the 4th of June; on the 8th their 
fishing-net was torn to pieces by blocks of drifting ice.&nbsp; 
On the 28th Badcock died, begging his comrades to sing a hymn to 
him in <!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>his last moments.&nbsp; In August, 
Gardiner, hitherto the healthiest, was obliged to take to his bed
in the <i>Pioneer</i>, and there heard of the death of Erwin on 
the 23rd of August, and of Bryant on the 27th.&nbsp; Maidment 
buried them both, and came back to Captain Gardiner, who, as he 
lay in bed, had continued his journal, and written his farewell 
letters to his wife and children.&nbsp; Hitherto, the stores of 
food had been eked out by mussels and wild celery, but there was 
now no one to search for them.&nbsp; Gardiner, wishing to save 
Maidment the journeys to and fro, determined to try to reach the 
<i>Speedwell</i>, and Maidment cut two forked sticks to serve as 
crutches, but the Captain found himself too weak for the walk, 
and had to return.&nbsp; This was on the 30th of August.&nbsp; On
Sunday, the 31st, there is no record in the diary, but the 
markers stand in his Prayer-book at the Psalms for the day and 
the Collect for the Sunday.&nbsp; On the 3rd of September, 
Maidment was so much exhausted that he could not leave his bed 
till noon, and Gardiner never saw him again.&nbsp; He must have 
died in the <i>Pioneer</i> cavern, being unable to return.&nbsp; 
The diary continues five days longer.&nbsp; A little 
peppermint-water had been left by the solitary sufferer&rsquo;s 
bed, and a little fresh water he also managed to scoop up from 
the sides of the boat in an india-rubber shoe.&nbsp; This was all
the sustenance he had.&nbsp; On the 6th of September he 
wrote&mdash;&ldquo;Yet a little while, and through grace we may 
join that blessed throng to sing the praises of Christ throughout
eternity.&nbsp; I neither hunger nor thirst, though five days 
without food!&nbsp; Marvellous loving-kindness to me, a 
sinner.&nbsp; Your affectionate brother in <span 
class="smcap">Christ</span>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Allen F. 
Gardiner</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words were in a letter to Williams.&nbsp; He must 
afterwards have left the boat, perhaps to catch more water, and 
have been too weak to climb back into it, for his remains were on
the beach.&nbsp; Williams lost the power of writing sooner, and 
no more is known of his end, though probably he died first, and 
Pearce must have been trying to prepare his grave when he, too, 
sank.</p>
<p>What words can befit this piteous history better than 
&ldquo;This is the patience of the saints&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The memorial to Allen Gardiner has been a mission-ship bearing
his name, with her head-quarters at the Falkland Isles.&nbsp; We 
believe that these isles are to become a Bishop&rsquo;s 
See.&nbsp; Assuredly a branch of the Church should spring up 
where the seed of so patient and devoted a martyrdom has been 
sown.</p>
<h2><!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>CHAPTER XI.&nbsp; CHARLES FREDERICK 
MACKENZIE, THE MARTYR OF THE ZAMBESI.</h2>
<p>That Zulu country where poor Allen Gardiner had made his first
attempt became doubly interesting to the English when the 
adjoining district of Natal became a British colony.&nbsp; It 
fell under the superintendence of Bishop Robert Gray, of 
Capetown, who still lives and labours, and therefore cannot be 
here spoken of; and mainly by his exertions it was formed into a 
separate Episcopal See in the year 1853.&nbsp; Most of the actors
in the founding of the Church of Natal are still living, but 
there are some of whom it can truly be said that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Death hath moulded into calm 
completeness<br />
The statue of their life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charles Frederick Mackenzie was born in 1825 of an old 
Scottish Tory family, members from the first of the Scottish 
Church in the days of her persecution.&nbsp; His father, Colin 
Mackenzie, was one of Walter Scott&rsquo;s fellow-Clerks of 
Session, and is commemorated by one of the Introductions to 
&ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo; as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He whose absence we deplore,<br />
Who breathes the gales of Devon&rsquo;s shore;<br />
The longer missed, bewailed the more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His mother was Elizabeth Forbes, and he was the youngest of so
unusually large a family that the elders had been launched into 
the world before the younger ones were born, so that they never 
were all together under one roof.&nbsp; The father&rsquo;s 
delicacy of health kept the mother much engrossed; the elder 
girls were therefore appointed as little mothers to the younger 
children, and it was to his eldest sister, Elizabeth (afterwards 
Mrs. Dundas), that the young Charles always looked with the 
tender reverence that is felt towards the earliest strong 
influence for good.</p>
<p>From the first he had one of those pure and stainless natures 
that seem to be good without effort, but his talents were only 
considered remarkable for arithmetic.&nbsp; His elder brothers 
used <!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>to set him up on a table and try to 
puzzle him with questions, which he could often answer mentally 
before they had worked them out on their slates.&nbsp; His father
died in 1830, after so much invalidism and separation that his 
five-year-old boy had no personal recollection of him.&nbsp; The 
eldest son, Mr. Forbes Mackenzie, succeeded to the estate of 
Portmore, and the rest of the family resided in Edinburgh for 
education.&nbsp; Charles attended the Academy till he was 
fifteen, when he was sent to the Grange School at Bishop&rsquo;s 
Wearmouth, all along showing a predominant taste for mathematics,
which he would study for his own amusement and assist his elder 
brothers in.&nbsp; His perfect modesty prevented them from ever 
feeling hurt by his superiority in this branch, and he held his 
place well in classics, though they were not the same delight to 
him, and were studied rather as a duty and as a step to the 
ministry of the Church, the desire of his heart from the 
first.&nbsp; At school, his companions respected him heartily, 
and loved him for his unselfish kindness and sweetness, while a 
few of the more graceless were inclined to brand him as soft or 
slow, because he never consented to join in anything blameable, 
and was not devoted to boyish sports, though at times he would 
join in them with great vigour, and was always perfectly 
fearless.</p>
<p>From the Grange he passed to Cambridge, and was entered at St.
John&rsquo;s, but finding that his Scottish birth was a 
disadvantage according to restrictions now removed, he 
transferred himself to Caius College.&nbsp; He kept up a constant
correspondence with his eldest sister, Mrs. Dundas, and from it 
may be gathered much of his inner life, while outwardly he was 
working steadily on, as a very able and studious 
undergraduate.&nbsp; With hopes of the ministry before his eyes, 
he begged one of the parochial clergy to give him work that would
serve as training, and accordingly he was requested to read and 
pray with a set of old people living in an asylum.&nbsp; The 
effort cost his bashfulness much, but he persevered, with the 
sense that if he did not go &ldquo;no one else would,&rdquo; and 
that his attempts were &ldquo;better than nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
This was the key to all his life.&nbsp; At the same time he felt,
what biography shows many another to have done, the influence of 
the more constant and complete worship then enjoined by college 
rules.&nbsp; Daily service was new to him, and was accepted of 
course as college discipline, but after a time it gathered force 
and power over his mind, and as the <i>Magnificat</i> <!-- page 
287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
287</span>had been a revelation to Henry Martyn, so Charles 
Mackenzie&rsquo;s affection first fixed upon the General 
Thanksgiving, and on the commemoration of the departed in the 
prayer for the Church Militant.</p>
<p>His fellow-collegians thought of him as a steady, 
religious-minded man, but not peculiarly devout, and indeed the 
just balance of his mind made him perceive that the prime duty of
an undergraduate was industry rather than attempts to exercise 
his yet unformed and uncultivated powers.&nbsp; In 1848 he was 
second wrangler.&nbsp; There were two prizes, called Dr. 
Smith&rsquo;s, for the two most distinguished mathematicians of 
the year.&nbsp; The senior wrangler&rsquo;s papers had the first 
of these; for the second, Mackenzie was neck and neck with a 
Trinity College man, and the question was only decided by the 
fact that Dr. Smith had desired that his own college (Trinity) 
should have the preference.</p>
<p>After this he became tutor and fellow of his college, taking 
private pupils, and at the same time preparing for Holy Orders, 
not only by study of books, but by work among the poor, with whom
his exceeding kindness and intense reality gave him especial 
influence at all times.</p>
<p>He was ordained on the Trinity Sunday of 1851, and took an 
assistant curacy at a short distance from Cambridge, his vigorous
powers of walking enabling him to give it full attention as well 
as to his pupils and to the University offices he filled.&nbsp; 
His great characteristic seems always to have been the tenderest 
kindness and consideration; and in the year when he was public 
examiner, this was especially felt by the young men undergoing an
ordeal so terrible to strained and excited intellect and nerves, 
when a little hastiness or harshness often destroys the hopes of 
a man&rsquo;s youth.</p>
<p>With this combination of pastoral work and college life 
Mackenzie was perfectly satisfied and happy, but in another year 
the turning-point of his life was reached.&nbsp; A mission at 
Delhi to the natives was in prospect, and the Rev. J. S. Jackson,
who belonged to the same college with him, came to Cambridge in 
search of a fellow-labourer therein.&nbsp; During the 
conversations and consultations as to who could be asked, the 
thought came upon Mackenzie, why should he strive to send forth 
others without going himself.&nbsp; He could not put it from his 
mind.&nbsp; He read Henry Martyn&rsquo;s life, and resolved on 
praying for <!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>guidance as to his own duty.&nbsp; 
In the words of his letter to Mrs. Dundas, &ldquo;I thought 
chiefly of the command, &lsquo;Go ye and baptize all 
nations,&rsquo; and how some one ought to go; and I thought how 
in another world one would look back and rejoice at having seized
this opportunity of taking the good news of the Gospel to those 
who had never heard of it; but for whom, as well as for us, 
Christ died.&nbsp; I thought of the Saviour sitting in heaven, 
and looking down upon this world, and seeing us, who have heard 
the news, selfishly keeping it to ourselves, and only one or two,
or eight or ten, going out in the year to preach to His other 
sheep, who must be brought, that there may be one fold and one 
Shepherd; and I thought that if other men would go abroad, then I
might stay at home, but as no one, or so few, would go out, then 
it was the duty of every one that could go to go. . . . And I 
thought, what right have I to say to young men here, &lsquo;You 
had better go out to India,&rsquo; when I am hugging myself in my
comfortable place at home.&rdquo;&nbsp; And afterwards, 
&ldquo;Now, dear Lizzie, I have always looked to you as my mother
and early teacher.&nbsp; To you I owe more than I can ever repay,
more than I can well tell.&nbsp; I do hope you will pray for me 
and give me your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dundas&rsquo;s reply to this letter was a most wise and 
full expression of sympathy with the aspiration, given with the 
deep consideration of a peculiarly calm and devotional spirit, 
which perceived that it is far better for a man to work up to his
fullest perception of right, and highest aims, than to linger in 
a sphere which does not occupy his fullest soul and highest self;
and she also recognized the influence that the fact of one of a 
family being engaged in such work exercises on those connected 
with them.</p>
<p>Others of the family, however, were startled, and some of his 
Cambridge friends did not think him adapted to the Delhi Mission,
and this therefore was given up, but without altering the bent 
that his mind had received; and indeed Mrs. Dundas, in one of her
beautiful letters, advised him to keep the aim once set before 
him in view, and thus his interest became more and more turned 
towards the support of missionary work at home.</p>
<p>In 1854, the first Primate of New Zealand, George Augustus 
Selwyn, visited England, after twelve years of labour spent in 
building up the Colonial and Maori Church, and of pioneering for 
missions in the Melanesian Isles, over which his vast see <!-- 
page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
289</span>then extended.&nbsp; He preached a course of four 
sermons at Cambridge; Mackenzie was an eager listener, and those 
forcible, heart-stirring discourses clenched his long growing 
resolution to obey the first call to missionary labour that 
should come to him, though, on the other hand, he desired so far 
to follow the leadings of Providence that he would not choose nor
volunteer, but wait for the summons&mdash;whither he knew 
not.</p>
<p>Ere long the invitation came.&nbsp; The erection of the colony
of Natal into a Bishop&rsquo;s See had been decided upon a year 
before, and it had been offered to John William Colenso, a 
clergyman known as active in the support of the missionary cause,
and a member of the University of Cambridge.&nbsp; On his 
appointment he had gone out in company with the Bishop of 
Capetown to inspect his diocese and study its needs, as well as 
to lay the foundations of future work.&nbsp; In the party who 
then sailed for Natal was a lady who had recently been left a 
widow, Henrietta Woodrow by name, ardent in zeal for the 
conversion of the heathen, and hoping that the warm climate of 
Africa would enable her to devote herself to good works more 
entirely than her delicate health permitted at home.</p>
<p>Pieter Maritzburg had by this time risen into a capital, with 
a strange mixture of Dutch and English buildings; but the English
population strongly predominated.&nbsp; Panda was king of the 
Kaffirs, and fearfully bloody massacres had taken place in his 
dominions, causing an immense number of refugees to take shelter 
in the English territory.&nbsp; Young people who thus came were 
bound apprentices to persons who would take charge of them for 
the sake of their services, and thus the missions and those 
connected with them gained considerable influence for a 
time.&nbsp; A Kaffir, who must have been Captain Gardiner&rsquo;s
faithful Umpondobeni, though he was now called by another name, 
inquired for his former good master, and fell into an agony of 
distress on hearing of his fate.</p>
<p>Mrs. Woodrow at once opened an orphanage for the destitute 
English children that are sure to be found in a new colony, where
the parents, if unsuccessful, are soon tempted to drink, and then
fall victims to climate and accident.&nbsp; The Kaffir servant 
whom she engaged had already been converted, and was baptized by 
the name of Abraham, soon after he entered her service; but 
&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo;&mdash;the name at first given to 
him,&mdash;became a sort of surname to him and to his 
family.&nbsp; While <!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>watching over the little band of 
children, Mrs. Woodrow was already&mdash;even though as yet only 
learning the language&mdash;preparing the way for the coming 
Church.&nbsp; She wrote of the Kaffirs: &ldquo;They come to me of
all ages, men and women, some old men from the country, with 
their rings upon their heads, and wrapped in their house 
blankets.&nbsp; Then they sit down on the kitchen floor, our 
&lsquo;Boy&rsquo; telling them, in his earnest way, about <span 
class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.&nbsp; These I cannot speak to,
but I manage to let them know that I care for them, and 
&lsquo;Boy&rsquo; says they go away with &lsquo;tears in their 
hearts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>About two years previously, a Scottish colonist at the Cape, 
named Robert Robertson, had been touched by the need of 
ministers; had been ordained by the Bishop of Capetown, and sent 
to Natal as missionary clergyman to the Zulus.&nbsp; Early in 
1855 these two devoted workers were married, and, taking up their
abode at Durban, continued together their care of the English 
orphans, and of the Kaffir children whom they could collect.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bishop Colenso, having taken his survey of 
the colony, had returned to England to collect his staff of 
fellow-workers; and one of his first requests was that Charles 
Mackenzie would accompany him as Archdeacon of Pieter 
Maritzburg.&nbsp; There was not such entire willingness in Mrs. 
Dundas&rsquo;s mind to part with him on this mission as on the 
former proposal; not that she wished to hold him back from the 
task to which he had in a manner dedicated himself, but she 
preferred his going out without the title of a dignitary, and, 
from the tone of the new Bishop&rsquo;s letters, she foresaw that
doctrinal difficulties and differences might arise.</p>
<p>Her brother had, however, made up his mind that no great work 
would ever be done, if those who co-operated were too minute in 
seeking for perfect accordance of opinions; and that boundless 
charity which was his great characteristic made him perhaps 
underrate the importance of the fissure which his sister even 
then perceived between the ways of thinking of himself and his 
Bishop.&nbsp; His next sister, Anne, whose health was too 
delicate for a northern climate, was to accompany him; and the 
entire party who went out with Bishop Colenso numbered thirty or 
forty persons, including several ladies, who were to devote 
themselves to education, both of the white and black 
inhabitants.&nbsp; They sailed in the barque <i>Jane Morice</i> 
early in <!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>the March of 1855, and, after a 
pleasant and prosperous voyage, entered Durban Bay in the ensuing
May.</p>
<p>The first home of the brother and sister was at Durban, among 
the English colonists.&nbsp; It somewhat disappointed the 
Archdeacon, as those who come out for purely missionary aims 
always are disappointed, when called to the equally needful but 
less interesting field of labour among their own countrymen; put 
as he says, he satisfied his mind by recollecting, &ldquo;I came 
out here simply because there was a scarcity of people that could
and would come.&nbsp; I did not come because I thought the work 
more important than that I was leaving.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he set 
himself heartily to gather and confirm the congregation that had 
had its first commencement when Allen Gardiner used to read 
prayers to the first few settlers; and, at the same time, Kaffir 
services were held for the some thousand persons in the town in 
the employment of the whites.</p>
<p>The Archdeacon read prayers in Kaffir, and Mr. Robertson 
preached on the Sunday evenings.&nbsp; The numbers of attendants 
were not large, and the most work was done by the school that the
Robertsons collected round them.&nbsp; The indifference and 
slackness of the English at Durban made it all the harder to work
upon the Kaffirs; and, in truth, Archdeacon Mackenzie&rsquo;s 
residence there was a troublous time.&nbsp; The endeavour, by the
wish of the Bishop, to establish a weekly offertory, was angrily 
received by the colonists, who were furious at the sight of the 
surplice in the pulpit, and, no doubt, disguised much real 
enmity, both to holiness of life and to true discipline, under 
their censure of what they called a badge of party.&nbsp; Their 
treatment of the Archdeacon, when they found him resolute, 
amounted to persecution; the most malignant rumours were set 
afloat, and nothing but his strength and calmness, perfect 
forgiveness, and yet unswerving determination, carried him 
through what was probably the most trying period of his life.</p>
<p>Intercourse with the Robertsons was the great refreshment in 
those anxious days.&nbsp; A grant from Government had been made 
for a Church Mission station upon the coast, and upon the river 
Umlazi, not many miles from Durban; and here Mr. and Mrs. 
Robertson stationed themselves with their little company of 
orphans, refugees, and Kaffirs; also a Hottentot family, whose 
children they were bringing up.</p>
<p>Their own house had straight walls, coffee-coloured, a brown 
<!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
292</span>thatched roof, and a boarded floor, in consideration of
Mrs. Robertson&rsquo;s exceeding delicacy of health; but such 
boards! loose, and so springy that the furniture leapt and danced
when the floor was crossed.&nbsp; It was all on the ground-floor,
partitioned by screens; and the thatched roof continued a good 
way out, supported on posts, so as to form a wide verandah; and 
scattered all around were the beehive dwellings of the Kaffir 
following, and huts raised for the nonce for European guests.</p>
<p>At six o&rsquo;clock in the morning a large bell was 
rung.&nbsp; At eight, Kaffir prayers were read by Mr. Robertson, 
for his own servants, in the verandah, and for some who would 
come in from the neighbouring kraals; then followed breakfast; 
then English matins; and, by that time, Kaffir children were 
creeping up to the verandah to be taught.&nbsp; They were first 
washed, and then taught their letters, with some hymns translated
into their language, and a little religious instruction.&nbsp; 
The children were generally particularly pleasant to deal with, 
bright and intelligent, and with a natural amiability of 
disposition that rendered quarrels and jealousies rare.&nbsp; 
Good temper seems, indeed, to be quite a Zulu characteristic; the
large mixed families of the numerous wives live together 
harmoniously, and the gift of a kraal to one member is 
acknowledged by all the rest.&nbsp; Revenge, violence, and 
passion are to be found among them, but not fretfulness and 
quarrelsomeness.</p>
<p>After the work of instruction, there was generally a ride into
the neighbouring kraals, to converse with the people, and invite 
the children to school.&nbsp; They had to be propitiated with 
packets of sugar, and shown the happy faces of the home 
flock.&nbsp; There was, at first, a good deal of inclination to 
distrust; and the endeavour to bring the women and girls to wear 
clothes had to be most cautiously managed, as a little over-haste
would make them take fright and desert altogether.</p>
<p>The Kaffir customs of marriage proved one of the most serious 
impediments in the way of the missionaries.&nbsp; The female sex 
had its value as furnishing servants and cultivators of the 
ground, and every man wished to own as many wives as 
possible.&nbsp; Not only did the question what was to be done in 
the case of many-wived converts come under consideration, but the
fathers objected to their daughters acquiring the rudiments of 
civilization, lest it should lessen their capabilities to act as 
beasts of burden, and thus spoil their price in cattle, <!-- page
293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
293</span>(the true <i>pecunia</i> of the Zulu).&nbsp; 
Practically, it was found, that no polygamist ever became more 
than an inquirer; the way of life seemed to harden the heart or 
blind the eyes against conviction; but the difficulty as regarded
the younger people was great, since as long as a girl remained 
the lawful property of the head of her kraal, she was liable to 
be sold to any polygamist of any age who might pay her value; and
thus it became a question whether it were safe to baptize 
her.&nbsp; Even Christian Zulus marrying Christian women 
according to the English rite could not be secure of them unless 
the cows were duly paid over; and as these Kaffirs are a really 
fine race, with more of the elements of true love in them than is
usual in savages, adventures fit for a novel would sometimes 
occur, when maidens came flying to the mission station to avoid 
some old husband who had made large offers to their father; and 
the real lover would arrive entreating protection for the lady of
his heart until he could earn the requisite amount of cows to 
satisfy her father.</p>
<p>Mr. Robertson was always called the umfundisi, or 
teacher.&nbsp; He held his Sunday Kaffir service in a clearing in
the bush, and gained many hearts to himself, and some souls for 
the Church, while toiling with his hands as well as setting forth
the truth with his lips.&nbsp; Mrs. Robertson at the same time 
worked upon the women by her tenderness to their little ones, 
offering them little frocks if they would wash them, caressing 
them with all a woman&rsquo;s true love for babies, and then 
training their elder children and girls, teaching them 
needlework, and whatever could lead to aspirations towards 
modesty and the other graces of Christian womanhood.&nbsp; Often 
extremely ill, always fragile, her energy never failed; and there
was a grace and dignity about her whole deportment and manner 
which caused &ldquo;the Lady&rdquo; to be the emphatic title 
always given to her by her husband and his friends.&nbsp; Of 
these the Mackenzie family were among the warmest, and the 
Archdeacon gladly gave valuable assistance to Mr. Robertson by 
supplementing an education which had not been definitely 
clerical, but rather of that order which seems to render an able 
Scotsman fit to apply himself to almost anything.</p>
<p>In February 1857 another sister, named Alice, joined the 
Mackenzie family, when they were on a visit to the Umlazi 
station.&nbsp; Her quick powers and enthusiastic spirit fitted 
her in a wonderful manner for missionary labour, and she was at 
once <!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>in such sympathy with the Kaffirs 
that it was a playful arrangement among the home party that Anne 
should be the white and Alice the black sister.</p>
<p>Just after her arrival, it was determined that the Archdeacon 
should leave Durban, where, indeed, he had been only filling the 
post of an absent clergyman, and take a district on the Umhlali 
river, forty miles from Durban, containing a number of English 
settlements, a camp, and a large amount of Kaffir kraals.&nbsp; 
Every Sunday he had five services at different places, one of 
them eighteen miles from the nearest, a space that had to be 
ridden at speed in the mid-day sun.&nbsp; There was no house, but
a couple of rooms with perpendicular sides and a verandah, one 
for chapel, the other for sitting-room, while Kaffir beehive huts
were the bedrooms of all.&nbsp; For a long time blankets and 
plaids did the part of doors and shutters; and just as the 
accommodations were improving, the whole grass and wattle 
structure was burnt down, and it was many months before the tardy
labour of colonial workmen enabled the family to take possession 
of the new house, in a better situation, which they named 
Seaforth, after the title of the former head of the Mackenzie 
clan.</p>
<p>All this time the whole party had been working.&nbsp; A school
was collected every morning of both boys and girls; not many in 
number, but from a large area: children of white settlers, 
varying in rank, gentlemen or farmers, but all alike running wild
for want of time and means to instruct them.&nbsp; They came 
riding on horses or oxen, attended by their Kaffirs, and were 
generally found exceedingly ignorant of all English learning, but
precocious and independent in practical matters: young boys able 
to shoot, ride, and often entrusted with difficult commissions by
their fathers at an age when their cousins at home would scarcely
be at a public school, and little girls accustomed to superintend
the Kaffirs in all household business; both far excelling their 
parents in familiarity with the language, but accustomed to 
tyrannize over the black servants, and in danger of imbibing 
unsuspected evil from their heathen converse.&nbsp; It was a task
of no small importance to endeavour to raise the tone, improve 
the manners, and instruct the minds of these young colonists, and
it could only be attempted by teaching them as friends upon an 
equality.</p>
<p>With the Kaffirs, at the same time, the treatment was <!-- 
page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
295</span>moulded on that of Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, who at one 
time paid the Umhlali a visit, bringing with them their whole 
train of converts, servants, orphans, and adopted children, who 
could be easily accommodated by putting up fresh grass huts, to 
which even the Europeans of the party had become so accustomed, 
that they viewed a chameleon tumbling down on the dinner-table 
with rather more indifference than we do the intrusion of an 
earwig, quite acquiesced in periodically remaking the clay floor 
when the white ants were coming up through it, scorpions being 
found in the Archdeacon&rsquo;s whiskers, and green snakes, 
instead of mice, being killed by the cat.</p>
<p>The sight of Christian Kaffirs was very beneficial to the 
learners, to whom it was a great stumbling block to have no 
fellows within their ken, but to be totally separated from all of
their own race and colour.&nbsp; At Seaforth, the wedding was 
celebrated of two of Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s converts, named 
Benjamin and Louisa, the marriage Psalms being chanted in Kaffir,
and the Holy Communion celebrated, when there were seven Kaffir 
communicants.&nbsp; The bride wore a white checked muslin and a 
wreath of white natural flowers on her head.&nbsp; This was the 
first Christian Zulu wedding, and it has been followed by many 
more, and we believe that in no case has there been a relapse 
into heathenism or polygamy.</p>
<p>The Mackenzies continued at Seaforth until the early part of 
the year 1859.&nbsp; The work was peaceful and cheerful.&nbsp; 
There were no such remarkable successes in conversion as the 
Robertsons met with, probably because in the further and wilder 
district the work was more pioneering, and the Robertsons had 
never been without a nucleus of Christians, besides which the 
gifts of both appear to have been surpassing in their power of 
dealing with natives, and producing thorough conversions.&nbsp; 
Moreover, they had no cure but of the Kaffirs, whereas Archdeacon
Mackenzie was the pastor of a widely scattered population, and 
his time and strength on Sundays employed to their very 
uttermost.&nbsp; Church affairs weighed heavily upon him; and 
another heavy sorrow fell on him in the death of the guardian 
elder sister, Mrs. Dundas.&nbsp; Her illness, typhus fever, left 
time for the preparation of knowing of her danger, and a letter 
written to her by her brother during the suspense breathes his 
resigned hope:&mdash;&ldquo;Dear Lizzie, you may now be among the
members of the Church in heaven, who <!-- page 296--><a 
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>have washed
their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&nbsp; 
If so, we shall never meet again on earth.&nbsp; But what a 
meeting in heaven!&nbsp; Any two of us to meet so would be, more 
than we can conceive, to be made perfect, and never more to 
part.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when writing to the bereaved husband after
the blow had fallen, he says: &ldquo;Surely we ought not to think
it strange if the brightest gems are sometimes removed from the 
workshop to the immediate presence of the Great King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the grief, though borne in such a spirit, probably made 
him susceptible to the only illness he experienced while in 
Natal.&nbsp; The immediate cause was riding in the burning sun of
a southern February, and the drinking cold water, the result of 
which was a fever, that kept him at home for about a month.</p>
<p>There was at this time a strong desire to send a mission into 
independent Zululand, with a Bishop at its head.&nbsp; Bishop 
Colenso was at first inclined to undertake the lead himself, 
resigning Natal; and next a plan arose that Archdeacon Mackenzie 
should become the missionary Bishop.&nbsp; The plan was to be 
submitted to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and 
for this purpose the Archdeacon was despatched to England, taking
Miss Mackenzie with him; but the younger sister, Alice, having so
recently arrived, and being so valuable as a worker among the 
natives, remained to assist in the school of young chiefs who had
been gathered together by Bishop Colenso.</p>
<p>The time of the return of the brother and sister was just when
Dr. Livingstone&rsquo;s account of the interior of Africa, and of
the character of the chiefs on the Zambesi, had excited an 
immense enthusiasm throughout England.&nbsp; He had appealed to 
the Universities to found a mission, and found it they would, on 
a truly grand scale, commensurate with their wealth and 
numbers.&nbsp; It was to have a Bishop at the head, and a strong 
staff of clergy, vessels built on purpose to navigate the rivers,
and every requisite amply provided.&nbsp; Crowded meetings were 
held at each University, and the enthusiasm produced by the 
appeal of Dr. Livingstone, a Scottish Presbyterian, to the 
English Universities, as the only bodies capable of such an 
effort, produced unspeakable excitement.&nbsp; At a huge meeting 
at Cambridge, attended by the most distinguished of English 
Churchmen, Archdeacon Mackenzie was present.&nbsp; His quiet 
remark to the friend beside him, was, &ldquo;I am <i>afraid</i> 
of this.&nbsp; Most great <!-- page 297--><a 
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>works have 
been carried on by one or two men in a quieter way, and have had 
a more humble beginning.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, Bishop Gray, of 
Capetown, had long been thinking of a Central African Mission; 
but his plan, and that which Mackenzie would have preferred, was 
to work gradually northwards from the places already Christian, 
or partially so, instead of commencing an isolated station at so 
great a distance, not only from all aid to the workers, but from 
all example or mode of bringing civilized life to the 
pupils.&nbsp; But Livingstone had so thoroughly won the 
sympathies of the country that only the exact plan which he 
advocated could obtain favour, and it was therefore felt that it 
was better to accept and co-operate with his spirit than to give 
any check, or divide the flow by contrary suggestions.</p>
<p>Thus Livingstone became almost as much the guide and referee 
of the Zambesi expedition as ever a Cardinal Legate was of a 
crusade.&nbsp; Nor could this be wondered at, for the ordinary 
Englishman is generally almost ignorant of missions and their 
history, and in this case an able and interesting book of travels
had stirred the mind of the nation; nor had experience then shown
how much more there was of the explorer than of the missionary in
the writer.</p>
<p>From the first, Archdeacon Mackenzie was designated as the 
chief of the mission.&nbsp; He felt the appointment a call not to
be rejected.&nbsp; His sister Anne viewed it in the same spirit, 
and was ready to cast in her lot with him, and letters were 
written to the other sister in Natal proposing to her to 
accompany them.&nbsp; Then came a year of constant travelling and
oratory in churches and on platforms, collecting means and 
rousing interest in the mission&mdash;a year that would have been
a mere whirl to any one not possessed of the wonderful calmness 
and simplicity that characterized Mackenzie, and made him just do
the work that came to hand in the best manner in his power, 
without question or choice as to what that work might be.</p>
<p>By the October of 1860 all was ready, and the brother and 
sister had taken leave of the remaining members of their family, 
and embarked at Southampton, together with two clergymen, a lay 
superintendent, a carpenter and a labourer, and likewise Miss 
Fanny Woodrow, Mrs. Robertson&rsquo;s niece, who was to join in 
her work.&nbsp; Their first stage was Capetown, where it had been
arranged that the consecration should take place, since it is 
best that a Missionary Bishop governing persons not <!-- page 
298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
298</span>under English government should not be fettered by 
regulations that concern her Prelates, not as belonging to the 
Church, but to the Establishment.&nbsp; There was some delay in 
collecting the bishops of South Africa, so that the 
<i>Pioneer</i>, placed at Dr. Livingstone&rsquo;s disposal, could
not wait; and the two clergy, Mr. Waller and Mr. Scudamore, 
proceeded without their chief.</p>
<p>On the 1st of January, 1861, the rite took place, memorable as
the first English consecration of a Missionary Bishop, and an 
example was set that has happily been since duly followed, as the
Church has more and more been roused to the fulfilment of the 
parting command, &ldquo;Go ye, and teach <i>all</i> 
nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, on the 7th, the new Bishop sailed in H.M.S. <i>Lyra</i>, 
Captain Oldfield, which had been appointed, in the course of its 
East African cruise, to take him to the scene of his labours, on 
the way setting down the Bishop of Natal at his diocese.&nbsp; 
The first exploration and formation of a settlement had been 
decided to be too arduous and perilous for women, especially for 
such an invalid as Miss Mackenzie, and she was therefore left at 
Capetown, to follow as soon as things should be made ready for 
her.&nbsp; The so-called black sister, who then fully intended 
also to be a member of the Central African Mission, came down to 
meet her brother at Durban, and a few days of exceeding peace and
joy were here spent.&nbsp; The victory over his opponents at 
Durban had been won by the recollection of his unfailing meekness
and love; they hailed him with ardent affection and joy, 
expressed their regret for all that had been unfriendly, and 
eagerly sought for all pastoral offices at his hand.&nbsp; He 
consecrated a church, and held a confirmation at the Umlazi; but 
the Robertsons were not there to welcome him.&nbsp; The 
long-contemplated mission into independent Zululand had devolved 
upon Mr. Robertson, and he and his wife, and the choicest and 
most trustworthy of their converts, had removed across the Tugela
into the territories of old King Panda, the last of the terrible 
brotherhood, and now himself greatly ruled by the ablest and most
successful of his sons, Ketchewayo by name.&nbsp; The work was 
very near Bishop Mackenzie&rsquo;s heart, and, both with 
substantial aid, prayers, blessings, and encouragements, he 
endeavoured to forward it.</p>
<p>His last day in Natal was spent in a service with a 
confirmation at Claremont, and an evening service at 
Durban.&nbsp; &ldquo;As we were returning,&rdquo; wrote his 
sister Alice, &ldquo;we saw a rocket <!-- page 299--><a 
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>from the 
sea; a gun fired, the mail was in; and the captain, who was with 
us, said he would let us know the first thing in the morning the 
hour he would sail.&nbsp; Well, after this, there was little 
peace or quiet.&nbsp; We were too tired to sit up that night, and
next morning there was much to arrange, and everybody was coming 
and going, and we heard we were to go by the half-past two 
train.&nbsp; A great many friends were with us, but on the shore 
we slipped away, and, leaning together on a heap of bricks, had a
few sweet, quiet collects together, till we were warned we must 
go to the boat.&nbsp; We went on board the tug, and stood 
together high up on the captain&rsquo;s place; we were washed 
again and again by the great waves.&nbsp; When he went, and I had
his last kiss and blessing, his own bright, beautiful spirit 
infected mine, and I could return his parting words without 
flinching; I saw him go without even a tear dimming my eye: so 
that I could watch him to the last, looking after our little boat
again crossing the bar, till we could distinguish each other no 
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In speaking one day of happiness, he said, &lsquo;I 
have given up looking for that altogether.&nbsp; Now, till death,
my post is one of unrest and care.&nbsp; To be the sharer of 
everyone&rsquo;s sorrow, the comforter of everyone&rsquo;s grief,
the strengthener of everyone&rsquo;s weakness: to do this as much
as in me lies is now my aim and object; for, you know, when the 
members suffer, the pain must always fly to the 
head.&rsquo;&nbsp; He said this with a smile, and oh! the peace 
in his face; it seemed as if nothing <i>could</i> shake 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last photograph, taken during this visit to Durban, with 
the high calm brow, and the quiet contemplative eye, bears out 
this beautiful, sisterly description of that last look.</p>
<p>The <i>Lyra</i> next proceeded to the Kongone mouth of the 
Zambesi, where the two parties who had gone forward, including 
Dr. Livingstone himself, were met, and a consultation took 
place.&nbsp; The Bishop was anxious to go forward, arrange his 
settlement, and commence his work at once; but Dr. Livingstone 
thought the season a bad one, and was anxious to explore the 
River Rovuma, to see whether its banks afforded a better opening;
and it ended in the Bishop feeling obliged to give way to his 
experience, although against his own judgment.</p>
<p>He therefore, with Mr. Rowley, who had joined him at Durban, 
accompanied Livingstone in the <i>Pioneer</i>, leaving the others
at Johanna, a little island used as a dep&ocirc;t for coal.</p>
<p><!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>The expedition was not successful; there was only water
enough in the channel to enable the <i>Pioneer</i> to go thirty 
miles up in five days, and it failed more and more in the 
descent.&nbsp; The steamer, too, though built for the purpose of 
navigating the shallows of rivers, drew more water than had been 
expected; the current when among shoals made the descent worse 
than the ascent; there was a continual necessity for landing to 
cut wood to feed the engine; and, in five days, the 
<i>Pioneer</i> had not made ten miles.&nbsp; The Bishop worked as
hard as any of the crew, once narrowly escaped the jaws of a 
crocodile, and had a slight touch of fever, so trifling that it 
perhaps disposed him to think lightly of the danger; but he was 
still weak when he came back to Johanna, and, by way of remedy, 
set out before breakfast for a mountain walk, and came back 
exhausted, and obliged to lie still, thoroughly depressed in mind
as well as body for two days.&nbsp; The expedition proved the 
more unfortunate, that it delayed the start for the Zambesi from 
February, when the stream was full, till May, when the water was 
so low that a great quantity of the stores had to be left behind,
in order that the <i>Pioneer</i> might not draw too much 
water.&nbsp; The chief assistants were the Malokolo, a portion of
a tribe who had attached themselves to Dr. Livingstone, and had 
been awaiting his return on the banks of the river.&nbsp; The 
Bishop would fain have gone without weapons of any sort, but Dr. 
Livingstone decided that this was impracticable.&nbsp; He said, 
by all means take guns, and use them, if needed, and they would 
prove the best pacificators; and Mackenzie, as usual, yielded his
own judgment, and heartily accepted what was decided on for 
him.</p>
<p>All those left at Johanna had suffered from fever, and were 
relieved that the time of inaction was over when they embarked in
the <i>Pioneer</i> on the 1st of May, and in due time ascended 
the Zambesi, and again the Shire, but very slowly, for much time 
was consumed in cutting wood for the engines, every <i>stick</i> 
in the mud costing three days&rsquo; labour, and in three weeks 
going only six or seven miles, seeing numerous crocodiles and 
hippopotami by the way.</p>
<p>It was not till the middle of July that they reached the 
landing-place.&nbsp; As soon as the goods had been landed the 
whole party set out on an exploration, intending to seek for a 
place, high enough on the hills to be healthy, on which to form 
their settlement.</p>
<p><!-- page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>Their goods were carried by negroes, and a good many by
themselves, the Bishop&rsquo;s share being in one hand a loaded 
gun, in the other a crozier, in front a can of oil, behind, a bag
of seeds.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;of the
contrast between my weapon and my staff, the one like Jacob, the 
other like Abraham, who armed all his trained servants to rescue 
Lot.&nbsp; I thought also of the seed which we must sow in the 
hearts of the people, and of the oil of the Spirit that must 
strengthen us in all we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The example of Abraham going forth to rescue Lot was brought 
suddenly before the mission party.&nbsp; While halting at a negro
village, a sound was heard like the blowing of penny trumpets, 
and six men, with muskets, came into the village, driving with 
them eighty-four slaves, men, women, and children, whom they had 
collected for Portuguese slave-dealers at Tette.</p>
<p>The Bishop and Mr. Scudamore had gone out of the village to 
bathe just before they arrived; but Dr. Livingstone, recognizing 
one of the drivers, whom he had seen at Tette, took him by the 
wrist, saying, &ldquo;What are you doing here, killing 
people?&nbsp; I shall kill you to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man answered: &ldquo;I do not kill; I am not making 
war.&nbsp; I bought these people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Livingstone turned to the slaves.&nbsp; Two men said, 
&ldquo;We were bought.&rdquo;&nbsp; Six said, &ldquo;We were 
captured.&rdquo;&nbsp; And several of the women, &ldquo;Our 
husbands and relatives were killed, and here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Livingstone began to cut the bonds of cord that 
fastened them together, while the slave-catchers ran away.&nbsp; 
All this was over before the Bishop returned; and Livingstone was
explaining to the rescued negroes that they might either return 
to their homes, go to Tette, or remain under English protection, 
while they expressed their joy and gratitude by a slow clapping 
of the hands.&nbsp; They told a terrible story, of women shot for
trying to escape, and of a babe whose brains were dashed out, 
because its mother could not carry it and her brothers 
together.</p>
<p>If asked by what authority he did these things, Livingstone 
would have answered, by the right of a Christian man to protect 
the weak from devilish cruelty.&nbsp; There was no doubt in his 
mind that these slaves, even though purchased, were deprived of 
their liberty so unjustly, that their deliverance was only a 
sacred duty, and that their owners had no right of property in 
them.&nbsp; If a British cruiser descended on a slave-ship, and 
<!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
302</span>released her freight, should he not also deliver the 
captive wherever he met him?</p>
<p>And, with this, another question was raised, namely, that of 
the use of weapons.&nbsp; The party were in the country of the 
Man-gnaja, a tribe of negroes who were continually harried by the
fiercer and more powerful neighbour-tribe of Ajawa, great 
slave-catchers, who supplied the slave-hunters who came out from 
Tette to collect their human droves.&nbsp; These were mostly 
Arabs, with some Portuguese admixture; and the blacks, after 
being disposed of in the market at Tette, were usually shipped 
off to supply the demand in Arabia and Egypt, where, to tell the 
truth, their lot was a far easier one than befell the slaves of 
the West, the toilers among sugar and cotton.</p>
<p>A crusade against slave-catching could not be carried on 
without, at least, a show of force; and, this granted, a further 
difficulty presented itself, in the fact that, out of the scanty 
number of white men, one was a bishop and two were priests of the
English Church, and one a Presbyterian minister.&nbsp; In all 
former cases, the missionaries had freely ventured themselves, 
using no means of self-defence, and marking the difference 
between themselves and others by the absence of all 
weapons.&nbsp; But, in those places, it was self-defence that was
given up; here the point was, whether to deliver the captive, or,
by silence, to acquiesce in the wrong done to him; and if his 
rescue were attempted, it was in vain, unless the clergy 
assisted; and thus it was that the mission party did not march so
much as men of peace as deliverers of the captive and breakers of
the yoke.&nbsp; The captives had no power of returning home, and 
chose to remain with their deliverers; and the next day the party
reached a negro village, called Chibisa&rsquo;s, after the chief 
who had ruled it at the time of Dr. Livingstone&rsquo;s first 
visit.&nbsp; He was now dead, but his successor, Chigunda, begged
the white men to remain, to protect him from the Ajawa, who were 
only five or ten miles off, and from whom an attack was 
expected.</p>
<p>It was decided to forestall it by marching towards them.&nbsp;
On the way another great convoy of slaves was encountered, and 
with the merest show of force, no bloodshed at all, more than 
forty were liberated&mdash;the men from forked clogs to their 
necks, consisting of a pole as thick as a man&rsquo;s thigh, 
branched at the top like the letter Y, so that the neck of the 
prisoner could be inserted, and fastened with an iron pin.</p>
<p><!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>The large number of these liberated captives made it 
necessary to choose a home, but Chibisa&rsquo;s was not the place
selected, but a spot some sixty miles further on, called 
Magomero.&nbsp; It was on a plain 3,000 feet above the level of 
the sea, or rather in a hole on the plain; for it was chosen 
because the bend of a river encircled it on three sides, so that 
a stockade on the fourth would serve for defence, in case of an 
attack from the Ajawa; and this consideration made Livingstone 
enforce the choice upon the Bishop, who again yielded to his 
opinion.&nbsp; The higher ground around was not unhealthy; the 
air was pure, the heat never excessive; but the river was too 
near, and brought fever to a spot soon overcrowded.&nbsp; It was 
occupied, however, with high hope and cheerfulness; huts, formed 
of poles and roofed with piles of grass, were erected, a larger 
one set apart for a church, and a system established of regular 
training for the numerous troop of clients, now amounting to 
above a hundred.&nbsp; To give them regular religious 
instruction, without being secure of the language, was thought by
the Bishop inexpedient, and he therefore desired, at first, to 
prepare the way by the effects of physical training and 
discipline.&nbsp; This was a Magomero day:&mdash;English matins 
at early morning; breakfast on fowls or goats&rsquo;-flesh, yam, 
beans, and porridge; then a visit to the sick; for, alas! already
the whole thirteen of the mission staff were never well at the 
same time.&nbsp; After this, the negroes were collected, answered
to their names, and had breakfast served out to them; two women 
being found to receive and apportion the shares of the lesser 
children, and this they did carefully and kindly.</p>
<p>The tender sweetness of Mackenzie told greatly in dealing with
these poor creatures.&nbsp; He did not think it waste of time to 
spend an hour a day trying to teach the little ones their 
letters; and Mr. Rowley draws a beautiful picture of him feeding,
with a bottle, a black babe, whose mother had not nutriment 
enough to sustain it,&mdash;the little naked thing nestling up to
his big beard, and going to sleep against his broad chest.</p>
<p>Work followed.&nbsp; One whith man drilled the boys, one 
command being for them all to leap into the river at the same 
moment to bathe; one bargained with the vendors of mealies, beer,
goats, fowls, yams, &amp;c., who came in numbers from the 
villages round, and received payment in beads, and a blue cotton 
manufacture, called selampore, which is the current coin of 
Central Africa.&nbsp; Others worked, and showed how to work, <!--
page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
304</span>at the buildings till one o&rsquo;clock, when the 
dinner was served, only differing from breakfast in the drink 
being native beer instead of coffee.&nbsp; Rest followed till 
five, when there were two hours&rsquo; more work, nearly till 
sunset, which, even on the longest day, was before half-past six;
then tea, evensong, and bed.</p>
<p>The great need was of some female element, to train and deal 
with the women and girls; and there was an earnest desire for the
arrival of the sisters.&nbsp; But, in the meantime, the 
occupation of Magomero proved far from peaceful.&nbsp; The Ajawa 
were always coming down upon the Man-gnaja to burn their villages
and steal slaves, and the Man-gnaja called upon the whites as 
invincible allies.</p>
<p>The Bishop and his clergy (Livingstone had now left them, and 
gone on to Lake Nyassa) thought that to present a resolute front 
to the Ajawa would drive them back for good and all; and that the
Man-gnaja could be bound over henceforth to give up 
slave-dealing, and, on this condition, they did not refuse their 
assistance.&nbsp; Subsequent events have led to the belief that 
this warfare of the Ajawa was really the advance of one of those 
great tides of nations that take place from time to time, and 
that they were a much finer people than the cowardly and false 
Man-gnaja; but, of course, a small company of strangers, almost 
ignorant of the language, and communicating with the natives 
through a released and educated negro, could not enter into the 
state of things, and could only struggle against the immediate 
acts of oppression that came before them.</p>
<p>There were thus about three expeditions to drive back the 
Ajawa and deliver the rescued slaves&mdash;bloodless expeditions,
for the sight of the white men and their guns was quite enough to
produce a general flight, and a large colony of the rescued had 
gathered at Magomero in the course of a few months.&nbsp; 
Meantime another clergyman, the Rev. H. De Wint Burrup, with his 
newly-married wife and three lay members of the mission, had 
arrived at Capetown, and, leaving Mrs. Burrup there with Miss 
Mackenzie, had come on to join the others.&nbsp; Mr. Burrup and 
Mr. Dickinson (a surgeon) actually made their way in canoes and 
river boats from Quillinane up to Chibisa&rsquo;s, where the 
<i>Pioneer</i> was lying, Dr. Livingstone having just returned 
from his three months&rsquo; expedition.</p>
<p>It was an absolute exploit in travelling, but a very perilous 
one, since these open boats, in the rain and on the low level of 
<!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
305</span>the river, exposed them to the greatest danger of 
fever; and there can be no doubt that their constitutions were 
injured, although, no serious symptoms appearing, the mission 
party were still further induced to underrate the necessity of 
precaution.</p>
<p>The Bishop coming down to visit Livingstone (seventy miles in 
thirty hours on foot), gladly hailed the new-comers, and returned
rapidly with Mr. Burrup, both a good deal over-fatigued; and, 
indeed, the Bishop never thoroughly recovered this reckless 
expenditure of strength.&nbsp; He considered that things were now
forward enough for a summons to the ladies at Capetown.&nbsp; 
Communication was very difficult, and the arrangements had 
therefore to be made somewhat blindly; but his plan was, that his
sisters and Mrs. Burrup should try to obtain a passage to 
Kongone, where the <i>Pioneer</i> should meet them, and bring 
them up the rivers to the landing-place at Chibisa&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
He did not know of his sister Alice&rsquo;s marriage at Natal, 
though he would have rejoiced at it if he had known.&nbsp; He 
himself intended to come down to the spot where the rivers Shire 
and Ruo meet, and there greet the sister and the wife on board 
the <i>Pioneer</i>, and return with them to Magomero.</p>
<p>The way by the river and by Chibisa&rsquo;s was a great 
circuit, and it was thought that a more direct way might be found
by exploration.&nbsp; Mr. Procter and Mr. Scudamore, with the 
black interpreter, Charles Thomas, and some of the negroes, 
started to pioneer a way.&nbsp; After five days Charles appeared 
at Magomero, exhausted, foot-sore, ragged, and famished, having 
had no food for forty-eight hours, and just able to say 
&ldquo;the Man-gnaja attacked us; I am the only one who has 
escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had had some soup, he told that the party had come to 
a village where they had been taken for slave-dealers, and the 
natives, on finding they were not, put on a hostile appearance, 
and as they pushed on came out in great numbers with bows and 
arrows, insisting on their return.&nbsp; After consulting they 
thought it would be better to turn back and conciliate the chief,
rather than leave a nest of enemies in their rear, and they 
therefore turned.&nbsp; Unfortunately the negroes had caught 
sight of the 140 yards of selampore that they were taking with 
them as cash for the journey, and though the chief, who had been 
at Senna and Quillinane, was civil, there was much discontent at 
their not expending more in purchases of provisions; and Charles 
told them that their bearers had overheard plans <!-- page 
306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
306</span>for burning their huts in the night, killing them and 
taking their goods.&nbsp; They decided to escape; and occupying 
the chief&rsquo;s attention by a present of a bright scarf, they 
bade their men get under weigh.&nbsp; A cry arose, &ldquo;They 
are running away.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a rush upon them, and 
Charles managed to break through.&nbsp; He heard two shots fired,
and was pursued for some distance, but, as darkness came on, 
effected his escape.</p>
<p>It seems to have been just one of the cases when a little 
hesitation and uncertainty on the part of the civilized men did 
all the mischief by emboldening the savages.&nbsp; Of course it 
was necessary to rescue them, but as the Ajawa were but twenty 
miles off, and Magomero must be guarded, there was no choice but 
to have recourse to the Makololo, and thus let loose one set of 
savages against another.&nbsp; Just, however, as a message was 
being despatched to bring them, the two clergymen were seen 
returning.&nbsp; They too had walked eighty-five miles in 
forty-eight hours, and had had but one fowl between them.&nbsp; 
They had in fact got out of the village almost immediately after 
Charles, but closely beset with natives armed with bows and 
poisoned arrows.&nbsp; Some tried to wrest Mr. Procter&rsquo;s 
gun from him, and even got him down, when he defended himself 
with his heels, until Mr. Scudamore, who was a little in advance,
fired on his assailants, when they gave back; but an arrow aimed 
at him penetrated the stock of his gun so deeply that the head 
remained embedded in it.&nbsp; Firing both barrels, he produced a
panic, under cover of which they made their way into the bush, 
and contrived with much difficulty to reach home.</p>
<p>Six of their eight bearers gradually straggled in, and the 
last brought the following message from a chief in the next 
village: &ldquo;I am not in blame for this war; Manasomba has 
tried to kill the English, has stolen their baggage and their 
boy, and has kept two of your men.&nbsp; He says if the English 
want the men, let them come and buy them out, or else fight for 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared that Manasomba was not a Man-gnaja, and that his 
suspicions were excited by anything so inexplicable to the negro 
mind as white men going about with so much cloth without buying 
slaves nor much of anything else.</p>
<p>There were still two men to be rescued, and the question was, 
whether to wait for Livingstone, who was armed with authority to 
give a lesson to the negroes, or for the mission party to 
undertake it themselves, especially in the haste which was <!-- 
page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
307</span>needful in order to be in time for the meeting with the
<i>Pioneer</i>.&nbsp; They decided on the march, so as to release
the men, and thus were forced to break up the calm of the 
Christmas feast.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it is right to do it at all, it 
is right to do it on a holy day,&rdquo; was the Bishop&rsquo;s 
argument, and so the Christmas Day was spent, partly in walking, 
partly at Chipoka&rsquo;s village, where was held the Holy 
Communion feast.&nbsp; &ldquo;How wondrous,&rdquo; wrote the 
Bishop, &ldquo;the feeling of actual instantaneous communion with
all you dear ones, though the distance and means of earthly 
communication are so great and so difficult!&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
negroes of the neighbouring villages joined them, and they 
proceeded.&nbsp; Near Manasomba&rsquo;s village they met a large 
body of men, with whom the Bishop attempted to hold a parley, but
they ran away, and only discharged a few arrows.&nbsp; The 
village was deserted except by a few sheep, goats, and Muscovy 
ducks, and these were driven out and the huts set on fire.</p>
<p>This punishment was as a &ldquo;vindication of the English 
name,&rdquo; and as an act of self-defence, since any faltering 
in resolution among such savages would have been fatal; but, 
after all, the men were not recovered, and the expedition had 
been so exhausting that none of the party were really fit to push
on for the place of meeting with the <i>Pioneer</i>, nor would 
Chipoka give them guides or bearers in that direction, saying it 
was all occupied by Manasomba&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>They came back to Magomero grievously exhausted; Scudamore 
fell down on a bed only just alive, and even the Bishop, though 
he tried to act and speak with vigour, was evidently suffering 
from illness and over-fatigue.</p>
<p>But there was the appointment to be kept with Livingstone and 
the ladies at the Ruo, and, unfit as he was, he persevered, 
setting off with Burrup, sadly enough, for Scudamore was lying in
a dangerous state; but no one guessed that they would never meet 
again upon earth.</p>
<p>It was on the 4th of January, 1862, that they started with a 
few Malokolo and the interpreter Charles, and it was six weeks 
before the colony at Magomero heard any tidings.&nbsp; There the 
stores were all but exhausted, and having hardly any goods left 
for barter, there was little food to be obtained but green corn 
and pumpkin, most unsuited to the Englishmen&rsquo;s present 
state of health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in constant rain and through swollen streams, <!-- 
page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
308</span>Mackenzie and Burrup had made their way down to the 
river, and there with much difficulty obtained a canoe.&nbsp; On 
the first night of the voyage all the party, except the Bishop, 
wished to go on, because the mosquitoes rendered rest 
impossible.&nbsp; He thought moving on in the dark imprudent, but
gave up his own will, and even wrote jestingly afterwards on the 
convenience of making the mosquitoes act as a spur.&nbsp; The 
consequence was that they came suddenly upon a projecting bend; 
the boat upset, and everything they had was in the water.&nbsp; 
They spent more than an hour in recovering what could be brought 
up; but their powder and their provisions were spoilt, and, what 
was still worse, their medicines: including the quinine, almost 
essential to life, and that when they were thoroughly drenched in
the middle of an African night.</p>
<p>Making sure, however, of speedily meeting Dr. Livingstone, 
they pushed on; but when they came to Malo, the isle at the 
confluence of the Ruo and Shire, they learnt from the natives 
that the <i>Pioneer</i> had gone down the stream.&nbsp; The 
negroes could give no clear account of how long ago it had 
been.&nbsp; If they had known that it had been only five days, 
they would probably have put forth their speed and have overtaken
her, but they thought that a much longer time was intended, and 
that waiting for the return would be not only more prudent, but 
might enable them to make friends with the chief, and prepare for
a station to be established on the island.&nbsp; A hut was given 
them, and there was plenty of wholesome food on the island.</p>
<p>Inaction, is, however the most fatal curse in that land of 
fever.&nbsp; There is a cheerful letter written by the Bishop to 
his home friends, on the 14th and 15th of January; but his vigour
was flagging.&nbsp; He spoke with disappointment of the inability
of Dr. Livingstone to bring up stores to Chibisa&rsquo;s, and 
longed much for his sisters&rsquo; arrival, telling his companion
it would break his heart if they did not now come.&nbsp; He also 
wrote a strong letter to the Secretary of the Universities&rsquo;
Mission, begging for a steam launch to keep up the supplies, 
where the <i>Pioneer</i> had failed.&nbsp; Soon after this, both 
became grievously ill; the Bishop&rsquo;s fever grew violent, he 
perceived his danger, and told the Malokolo that <span 
class="smcap">Jesus</span> would come to take him, but he 
presently became delirious and insensible, in which condition he 
lay for five days, the Malokolo waiting on him as well as they 
could under Burrup&rsquo;s superintendence.</p>
<p><!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>The negro tribes have an exceeding dread of death, and 
a hut which has had a corpse in it is shut up for three 
years.&nbsp; Probably for this reason the chief begged that the 
dying man might be carried to another hut less needful to 
himself, and as he had been kind and friendly throughout Mr. 
Burrup thought it right to comply.&nbsp; Shortly after, on the 
afternoon of the 31st of January, the pure, gentle, and noble 
spirit passed away.&nbsp; The chief, from superstitious fear, 
insisted that the body should be immediately interred, and not on
the island, and Mr. Burrup and the Malokolo therefore laid it in 
their canoe, and paddled to the mainland, where a spot was 
cleared in the bush, the grave dug, and as it was by this time 
too dark to see to read, Mr. Burrup said all that he could 
remember of the burial service, the four blacks standing 
wondering and mournful by.</p>
<p>He saw that for himself the only hope was in a return to 
Magomero.&nbsp; The canoe was tried, but the current was so 
strong that such small numbers could not make head against 
it.&nbsp; He therefore proceeded on foot, but fell down 
repeatedly from weakness, and was only dragged on by his strong 
will and the aid of the Malokolo.&nbsp; They behaved admirably, 
and when he reached Chibisa&rsquo;s, and could walk no longer, 
they and the villagers contrived a palanquin of wood, and carried
him on in it.&nbsp; The chief, finding that his store of cloth 
(<i>i.e.</i> coin) was expended, actually offered him a present 
of some to carry him on.</p>
<p>On the 14th of February, one of the Malokolo appeared before 
the anxious colonists at Magomero.&nbsp; His face was that of a 
bearer of evil tidings, and when they asked for the Bishop, he 
hid his face in his hands.&nbsp; When they pressed further, he 
said, &ldquo;<i>wafa</i>, <i>wafa</i>&rdquo; (he is dead, he is 
dead).&nbsp; And while they stood round stunned, he made them 
understand that Burrup was at hand, so ill as to be carried on 
men&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done but to hurry out to meet him, 
taking the last drop of wine remaining.&nbsp; He had become the 
very shadow of himself, but even then he slightly rallied, and 
could he have had nourishing food, wine or brandy, the strength 
of his constitution would probably have carried him through; but 
the stores were exhausted, there was nothing to recruit his 
powers, and on the 23rd of February he likewise died.</p>
<p>Meantime, his young wife, with Miss Mackenzie and Mrs. 
Livingstone, had sailed in December in a wretchedly uncomfortable
little craft, called the <i>Hetty Ellen</i>.&nbsp; On reaching 
the <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>Kongone they saw no token of the 
<i>Pioneer</i>, but after waiting in great discomfort, tossing at
the mouth of the river, the vessel made for Mozambique.&nbsp; 
There they fell in with H.M.S. <i>Gorgon</i>.&nbsp; Captain 
Wilson, resolved to render them every service in his power, took 
the ladies on board, the vessel in tow, and carried them to 
Quillinane, where they presently fell in with Dr. Livingstone and
the <i>Pioneer</i>.</p>
<p>His little lake steamer, the <i>Lady Nyassa</i>, had been 
packed on board the <i>Hetty Ellen</i>, and had formed the only 
shelter Miss Mackenzie had from the sun, and the transference of 
this occupied some time.&nbsp; Then the unhappy <i>Pioneer</i> 
began to proceed at her snail&rsquo;s pace, one day on a 
sand-bank, another with the machinery out of order, continually 
halting for supplies of wood, and thinking a couple of miles a 
good day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Captain Wilson, shocked at the 
notion of women spending weeks in labouring up that pestiferous 
stream, beset with mosquitoes by night and tsetse flies by day, 
offered to man his gig and take them up himself.&nbsp; So 
desperate a journey was it for a frail invalid like Miss 
Mackenzie, that one of the sailors took a spade to dig her grave 
with; and in fact she was soon prostrated with fever.&nbsp; None 
of the party knew who lay sleeping in his grave under the 
trees.&nbsp; The natives on the island entirely denied having 
seen or heard anything of the Bishop, and never gave Mr. 
Burrup&rsquo;s letter, fearing perhaps that some revenge might 
fall on them.&nbsp; Baffled by not meeting him, Captain Wilson 
still would not leave the ladies till he should have seen them 
safe among their friends, and pushed on his boat with speed very 
unlike that of the tardy <i>Pioneer</i>, and thus, in a day and a
half, arrived at Chibisa&rsquo;s, where the Malokolo came down to
the boat, with tidings that, though their language was but 
imperfectly understood, were only too certain.&nbsp; The brave 
and tender-hearted leader of the mission was dead!&nbsp; Still 
there was hope of Mr. Burrup; but Captain Wilson would not allow 
the young wife to take the difficult journey only to find 
desolation, but went on by land himself, leaving her with Miss 
Mackenzie, under charge of his ship&rsquo;s surgeon, Dr. 
Ramsay.&nbsp; He came back after a few days, having become too 
ill by the way to get further than Soche, where he had been met 
by three of the mission party, who now returned with him to 
Chibisa&rsquo;s, with the tidings in all their sad fulness; and 
the mournful party set forth upon their return.&nbsp; On coming 
to the island, he demanded Mr. Burrup&rsquo;s <!-- page 311--><a 
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>letter, and
the negroes looked at one another, saying, &ldquo;It is all 
known.&rdquo;&nbsp; They gave him the letter, but it was with 
very great difficulty that they could be persuaded to show him 
the grave, over which he set up a cross of reeds, and then 
continuing this sad voyage, placed the ladies on board his ship, 
and carried them back to Capetown.</p>
<p>Bishop Mackenzie had executed a will not six weeks before his 
death, bequeathing to the Additional Bishoprics Fund his 
property, and to the mission his books, except those specially 
connected with his personal devotions, which were to go to his 
family, and which Captain Wilson brought down with him, the 
Bible, Prayer-book, and &ldquo;Christian Year,&rdquo; bearing 
tokens of that immersion in the water which, by the destruction 
of the medicines, may be believed to have been the chief cause of
his death.&nbsp; Until the arrival of a new Bishop, or of 
instructions from the Metropolitan of Capetown, the headship of 
the mission was to remain with the senior clergyman, or failing 
him, of the senior layman.&nbsp; Thus the little colony had their
instructions to wait and carry on the work: but further 
difficulties soon arose.&nbsp; Stores were still wanting, fever 
prevailed even among the negroes.&nbsp; All the class of little 
children whom the Bishop used to teach had died under it, each 
being baptized before its death, and the Ajawa began to threaten 
again.&nbsp; The lessened force, without a head, decided that, 
though their advance might drive the enemy back, it was better to
avoid further warfare, and relinquish the post at Magomero.&nbsp;
With the long train of helpless natives, then, the few white men 
set forth, and after several days&rsquo; tedious and weary march 
came to Chibisa&rsquo;s, where they founded a new station on a 
hill-side, above the native village, and tried to continue their 
old system; but by Christmas Mr. Scudamore had become fatally 
ill, and he died on the morning of New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1863, 
greatly lamented, not only by the remnant of his own party, but 
by all the negroes; and on the 17th of March he was followed by 
Dr. Dickinson.</p>
<p>We do not deal with those still living, therefore we will only
further mention that on the 26th of June following Bishop Tozer 
arrived at Chibisa&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He decided on removing to a 
place called Morumbala, a station nearer Quillinane, which he 
hoped might prove healthier, and out of the reach of the 
Ajawa.&nbsp; The remaining clergy of the mission were greatly 
concerned at this, <!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>for they had hopes of influencing 
the Ajawa, and besides, the negroes whom they had rescued, who 
had been now more than a year under their care, could not for the
most part be taken to Morumbala; for, though grieving much at 
losing their &ldquo;English fathers,&rdquo; they would be placed 
at a distance from their own tribe, among strangers and possible 
enemies.</p>
<p>The families who could provide for themselves were left at 
Chibisa&rsquo;s, Mr. Waller making the best terms in his power 
for them.&nbsp; It was sad to leave them without having more 
thoroughly Christianized them, but the frequent sicknesses of the
clergy, the loss of the chief pastor, and the want of some one to
take the lead, had prevented their instruction from being all 
that could have been hoped.&nbsp; They had become warmly attached
to the English, and had in many respects much improved, and it is
hoped that they may keep alive the memory of the training they 
have received, and prepare the way for better things.</p>
<p>There were about twenty orphan boys, for whom Bishop Tozer 
undertook to provide; but there were also ten or twelve women and
girls, the former old and infirm, the latter orphans, and these 
Mr. Waller could not bear to abandon, so he carried them with him
to Morumbala, and supported them at his own expense, until at the
end of five months it was decided to give up Morumbala, and fix 
the head-quarters of the Central African Mission at 
Zanzibar.&nbsp; Then, as it was not easy to convey the boys, or 
provide for them there, Mr. Waller took the charge of them 
likewise, and, with Dr. Livingstone&rsquo;s assistance, conveyed 
both them and the women and children to Capetown, where he 
succeeded in procuring homes for them in different families and 
mission schools or stations.&nbsp; All are now Christians, and 
show themselves gentle, and susceptible of training and 
education; nor have they much of that disposition so familiar to 
us in the transplanted negroes of Western Africa.&nbsp; Four boys
were brought to England, but the climate would soon have been 
fatal to them, and it is evident that Capetown or Natal and its 
dependencies must be the meeting ground of the English and 
African races, since there alone can both retain their vigour in 
the same climate.</p>
<p>Thus ended the first venture of the University mission, in the
sacrifice of four lives, which may be well esteemed as freely 
laid down in the cause of the Gospel.&nbsp; Such lives and such 
<!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
313</span>deaths are the seed of the Church.&nbsp; It is they 
that speak the loudest in calling for the fresh labourers; and 
though the Zanzibar Mission has drifted far away from the field 
of Mackenzie&rsquo;s labours, and has adopted a different system,
and though his toils in Natal never were allowed to continue long
enough in a single spot for him personally to reap their fruits 
upon earth, not only has his name become a trumpet call, but out 
of his grave has sprung, as it were, a mission in the very 
quarter where, had he been permitted, he would have spent his 
best efforts, namely, the free Zulu country, Panda&rsquo;s 
kingdom, to the north of the Tugela.</p>
<p>It has been already mentioned that Mr. and Mrs. Robertson had 
removed thither, from their station upon the Umlazi, taking with 
them a selection of their Christian Kaffirs, and settling, with 
the king&rsquo;s permission, at a place called Kwamagwaza.&nbsp; 
At first they lived in a waggon and tents, for, delicate and 
often ill as was Mrs. Robertson, she shrank from no hardship or 
exertion.&nbsp; She writes, &ldquo;My own health has been 
wonderful, in spite of much real suffering from the closeness of 
the waggon, and exposure to rain or hot sun, which is even more 
trying.&nbsp; I often have to sleep with the waggon open, and a 
damp foggy air flowing through to keep me from fainting, and I 
have often told myself, &lsquo;You might be worse off in the 
cabin of a steamer,&rsquo; that I might not pity myself too 
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hut was soon raised, and Mrs. Robertson here ruled in her 
own peculiarly dignified and tender way as the mother of the 
whole station, keeping guard there while her husband went on 
expeditions to visit the king and his son Ketchewayo, the chief 
executive authority.&nbsp; Another hut was raised to serve as a 
church, and the days were arranged much as those on the Umlazi 
had been.&nbsp; Children were born to the Christian couples, and 
Mrs. Robertson spent much time and care in teaching the mothers 
how to deal with them after a civilized and Christian 
fashion.&nbsp; Other children were sometimes brought to her to be
adopted, and when entirely made over by their parents were 
baptized and bred up as Christians.&nbsp; The general trust in 
Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s skill as a doctor brought many people under
his influence, and likewise gave some, though very slight 
assistance, in combating the belief in witchcraft, the worst 
enemy with which Christianity has to contend.</p>
<p><!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>Whenever a person falls sick or meets with an accident,
a conjurer is sent for, who attributes the disaster to some other
person, on whom revenge must be taken.&nbsp; In the British 
territory, no more can be done than to treat the supposed wizard 
with contumely, such as to render his life a burthen to him, and 
he can generally escape this by entering some white man&rsquo;s 
service, or attaching himself to a mission-station; but in 
independent Zululand, any disaster to prince or great chief was 
sure to be followed by a horrible massacre of the whole family of
the supposed offender, unless he had time to escape across the 
border.&nbsp; Many a time did wounded women and children fly from
the slaughter to Kwamagwaza, and Mr. and Mrs. Robertson protect 
them from the first fury of the pursuers, and then almost force 
consent from Ketchewayo to their living under the protection of 
the umfundisi.</p>
<p>Visits to Ketchewayo formed a very important part of the work,
since they gradually established his confidence in Mr. Robertson,
and obtained concessions that facilitated the Christianizing of 
his people.&nbsp; One of his great objections was the fear of 
losing their services as warriors.&nbsp; The regiments still 
assemble at his camp as in the days of Dingarn, go through their 
exercises and sing their war-songs, into some of which are 
introduced lines in contempt of the Kaffirs who have passed the 
Tugela to live under British law:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Natal people have no king,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They eat salt;<br />
To every tag-rag white man they say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Your 
Excellency!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Robertson&rsquo;s niece, Miss Fanny Woodrow, who had come
out to join her, arrived at Durban, and was there met by Mrs. 
Robertson herself, in her waggon, after the long and perilous 
journey undertaken alone with the Kaffirs.&nbsp; Her residence at
Kwamagwaza was a time of much interest and prosperity; she threw 
herself into the work, and much assisted in the training of the 
women and children, and one or two visits she made to Ketchewayo 
greatly delighted the prince.&nbsp; She came in June 1861, but 
she had become engaged on her way out to the Rev. Lovell Procter,
and when the mission at Chibisa&rsquo;s was given up, he was in 
such a state of health as not to be able to continue with the 
University Mission.&nbsp; Therefore <!-- page 315--><a 
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>he set out 
on his return, and, coming to Natal by the way, arrived at 
Kwamagwaza early in 1864.&nbsp; He was the first brother 
clergyman Mr. Robertson had seen since coming into Zululand, and 
the mingling of joy at the meeting, and of sorrow for Bishop 
Mackenzie, were almost overwhelming.&nbsp; At Easter Mr. Procter 
and Miss Woodrow were married, in the little mission church, 
built of bricks made by Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s own hands and those
of his pupils; and soon after Mr. and Mrs. Robertson set out in 
their waggon to escort the newly-married pair to Durban, taking 
with them several of their converts, and all their flock of 
adopted children.</p>
<p>The stay in Durban, and Pieter Maritzburg, among old friends, 
was full of comfort and pleasure; but the indefatigable 
missionary and his wife were soon on their way home, their waggon
heavily loaded with boxes sent by friends in England, containing 
much that they had longed for&mdash;among other things, iron-work
for fitting their church.&nbsp; On the 18th of June, when they 
were three days&rsquo; journey across the Tugela, while Mr. 
Robertson was walking in front of the waggon to secure a safe 
track for it, the wheels, in coming down a descent, slid along on
some slippery grass, and there was a complete overturn, the 
waggon falling on its side with the wheels in the air, and Mrs. 
Robertson, and a little Kaffir boy of three years old, under the 
whole of the front portion of the load.</p>
<p>Her husband and the Kaffirs cut away the side of the waggon 
with axes, and tried to draw her out, but she was too fast wedged
in.&nbsp; She said in a calm voice, &ldquo;Oh, remove the 
boxes,&rdquo; but before this could be done she had breathed her 
last, apparently from suffocation, for her limbs were not 
crushed, and her exceeding delicacy of frame and shortness of 
breath probably made the weight and suffocation fatal to 
her.&nbsp; The little boy suffered no injury.</p>
<p>The spot was near a Norwegian mission station, where the 
kindest help was immediately offered to the husband.&nbsp; A 
coffin was made of plank that had been bought at Durban to be 
made into church doors, and when her husband had kept lonely 
vigil all night over her remains, Henrietta Robertson was laid in
her grave, where the Norwegians hope to build their church, Mr. 
Robertson himself reading the service over her.</p>
<p>But her work has not died with her.&nbsp; Mr. Robertson 
returned to his lonely task, helped and tended by the converted 
man <!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>and his wife, Usajabula and 
Christina, whom she had trained, and whose child had been with 
her in the fatal overturn.&nbsp; A clergyman returning from the 
Zanzibar Mission came to him and aided him for a while; other 
helpers have come out from time to time, and meantime, Miss 
Mackenzie exerted herself to the utmost, straining every nerve to
obtain funds for the establishment of a Missionary Bishopric in 
Zululand, as the most fitting memorial to her brother, since it 
was here that, had he chosen for himself, his work would have 
lain.&nbsp; After several years of endeavour she has succeeded, 
and, even as these last pages are written, we hold in our hands 
the account of the arrival of the new Bishop at Kwamagwaza.</p>
<p>So it is that the work never perishes, but the very extinction
of one light seems to cause the lighting of many more; and thus 
it is that the word is being gradually fulfilled that the Gospel 
shall be preached to all nations, and that &ldquo;the earth shall
be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the 
waters cover the sea.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
